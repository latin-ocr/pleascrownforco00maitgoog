138 moras.

Then in Roii A a passage has been interpolated, stating how it was testi-
fied that Roger was not guilty, and how Richard of Clopton made fine
for him; but the clerk had not room to interpolate the names of Roger’s
pledges, so he tells us to see below (plegii ejus standi recto inferius) and
linds room for the names at the end of the entry. This procedureis
not uncommon, aad the reader must taire a general warning that some·
times the end of a case appears before the middle.

12. Emma the appellor is dead; Philip the appellee pays to have an
inquisition and the jurors aequit him. Seemingly he is acquitted hythe
same jurors who are in trouble for not presenting the appeal, namely, the
jurors of Kiftsgate hundred.

15. asoute fult ed duos comitatus, she had sued him in two (suc-
cessive) county courts. He could not be outlawed until the fourth, or,
according to another mode of rechoning, until the fifth, county court,
until i.e. he was quinto exactus. See Bracton f. 125 b.

18. retentus de bursis soiasis, accused of cutting purses.

20. The story, as told by the county, is this :- Adam sued Clement in
the hundred court for carrying off hay to the value of five shillings,
against the sherili's peace: Clement's defence was that he bought the hay
from Adam's mother, and it was adjudged in the hundred court that
Clement might make his law, i. e. establish his defence by his oath sup·
ported by the oaths of compurgators: this he was to do in the county
court; but when he carne there with his compurgators (cum legem), aad
was just going to make his law, Adam attempted to change the charge
into one of felony, mentioned the iring's peace instead of the sherili's,
and declared that Clement was just going to perjure himself aad
commit robbery by means of perjury. When the appeal coines before
the justices Clement first (as the fashion is) traverses the whole charge,
then pleads his facts specially, and produces his suit, his witnesses, aud
ndam’s mother, who is willing to warraut that she sold the hay.
Clement puts himself on a jury for these facts; but there is no need of
a jury, for the justices, having heard what happened in the local conns,
declare that the appeal is null, probably on the ground that Adam by

first suing in the county court has shown that there was no felony; but =

seemingiy Adam’s case was open to many objections. Α very similar
case will be found below N0. 99.

Adam levavit eum de lega. lt has been suggested to me that
this curious phrase contains a reminiscence of the classical meaning of
elevare. Adam asserted that Clement was not a person who should be v
allowed to swear, was not ooth-worthy, law-worthy.

Clemens venat et defendit toloniam ot paoem, ato.; the best
translation for defendere in such a context is ro deny; but of course our
law language, until quite lately, used to desem as equivalent for to deny.
The defendant in trespass defletaded tort and force and all that was
against the peace.

21. capud thethinga, the chief pledge, head-borough.

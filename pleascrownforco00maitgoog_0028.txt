great land-owning families were well represented. But, besides all
Ἴ these, there must have been a crowd of men neither rich nor
famous: we may know them, for their sumames, only just becom-
ing hereditary, still tell their occupatione. There are reeves, smiths,
millers‚ carpenters in abundance, the representatives oi their native
townshipS, and many who were not even representatives oi a town-
ship had cause to be at Gloucester as pledges, witnesses, finders os
dead bodies, suspected persons, and so forth.

It is more important to notice that the whole county (tolus comi-
tatus) was there as a whole, and we may say in a quasi-corporate
capacity. The court oi the eyre, besides being a royal court held
by the king’s judges‚ was also the ancient county court assembled

ior an extraordinary session. The county, or the county court (the
language ol the time has but one word ior the two), took an active

part in the criminal business. It could testiiy by word oi mouth,
for written record it had none, to what had happened at its ordinary
sessions¹; it could declare the customs oi the country; it could
say how Englishry ought to be presentent, whether the townships
within the Forest ol Dean had special privileges ³, whether Fairlord
might behave like a borough and swear by itseli ⁴ (serare per se),
and the like. ln what way the county spolie its mind on these
matters we are not told. Possibly it spolie by the mouths oi the
sheriff, the president oi its court, and the coroners, its elected
officers; but the voice ol the county seems to be distinguished ‚
from the voices oi sherili and coroners, and the county can contra·
dict the coroners⁶. It is not impossible that there were certain
leading men in the county who bore no distinct office, but yet had
a customary, ii not exactlya legal, right to declare the county’s
mind. Bracton’s printed text⁰ says that, aiter the ionnal opening
oi the eyre, the judges ought to take apart into some secret place
some lour or six or more of the great men oi the county, ‘qui
dicuntur busones comitatus, etad quorum nutum dependent vota
aliorum‚' and the y’udges are to treat with these busoms about the
keeping ol the king's peace. No satisfactory explanation oi this
strange word husones is forthcoming, and most critics have thought
that it is a mere mistalre sor barones. But there is a'record oi
John’s reign which spealrs of the husones of Gloucestershire ⁷. The

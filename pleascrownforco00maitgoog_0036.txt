xxxii INTRODUCTION.

discussed here l: suffice it that at the time of our eyre the doctrine
has taken firm root, that such a man ought to belong to an associa-
tion of persons, in general ten in number (theothinga, thethr'rrga,
decenno), whose duty it is to bring him to justice il he is charged
witha crime. Furtber it is the duty ol the township (vr'llala) to
provide that all persons resident within it shall belong to such an
association, and it this duty be not performed then the township
itsell will be amerccd There is no such duty as regards those who
are merely joumeying through the place; hence a constant contrast
between one who is martem and one who is itinerans. The town·
ship (vallata) must be clearly distinguished from the personal
association of men that constitutos a theolhr'nga or demna, nor must
we translate theothr'nga by φώκη, save trith the understanding that
it does not, at least primarily‚ refer to a territorial district. The
relation of the territoria] districts known as tythings to these
associations is a much disputed matter, but throughout this roll the
distinction is preserved, and indeed tythings as districts are never
mentioned. Thus it is noticed that in the township of Swell there
is but one decenno, therefore the amercement due on account of a
criminal's ssight falls on the whole nr'llata'. It seems very possible,
however, that this was tbe case in many townships. The decenne or
thetkinge are in general described by the name of the chief pledge,
head-borough, or tythingman (thethrirgeman, theothrirgeman); thus
we read of Edward tythingman of Campden and his whole tything².
But in a large number of cases we read merely of the frank-pledge
ofa certain township; thus suit in franco plegio villare de Kadts-
lade ⁴. Itis quite possible that this grouping of men into sets of
tens or dozens was by no means a very popular, very ancient, or
very universal institution, and was to a large extent the creation of
lawyers who were misled by texts in the ancient English laws ⁵. By
this time, however, there was machinery sor enforcing the theory. It
was the sheriff’s duty to hold view of hanla-pledge (uatus franci

Δ satisfied that in Herefordshire the ordinary law of malopast did not hold good,

in Sept. ¹²13¹· The rolls, until then eloquent about his doings,
become suddenly silent

But some time before this Gerard was succeeded in the shrievalty
of Gloucestershire by his kinsman Engelard of Cigogne. Engelard
had been very busy in the west with the lting's affairs for some
seven years before the sentence of banisbment went out against
him at Runnymede. But ‘covenants without the sword are but
words,' and the swerd was with Engelard. John was not going to
put him away; he was much too useful’. True that about a
month after the grant of the charter, the Ralph Musard who has
been named above as one of the judges commissioned in 1111,
relieved Engelard of Gloucestershire³; but Engelard was wanted

elsewhere, and must have proved himself a splendid soldier. At ,

the most critical moment, when Levis was about to land, the
county of Surrey and the important fortresses of Odiham and
Windsor were intrusted to Engelard ⁴. The defence of Odiham
by thirteen men against an army is the most brilliant episode of

the war. Engelard himself was in Windsor and stood a long siege .

stubbomly and successfdlyt When the new reign began there
could be no talk of banishing him. The charter, as re-issued in
1116 and again in 1217, had no word against the defendet of
Windsor. On the contrary, he was richly rewarded with lands and
wardships‚ and drew ahandsome pension from the Eucbequer⁰.
When the judges at Gloucester were investigating what he had
done as sheriff, he still held Windsor and Odiham. It is reported
that just at this time, being suspected of treason, he was attested
and forced to give pledges to deliver up Windsor when required ⁷.
Certainly, however, there was as yet no very serious breach between
him and the lting's advisers⁸. When in 1111, as a consequence
of this eyre, he was pressed to pay the large sum that was due
fr0m him in respectos his long shrievalty, he succeeded in estab-
lishing a set-off for the whole debt, having, as he said, spent much
money of his own in fortifying Bristol and Hereford⁰. But the
next outbreak, that of Fawlres of Breaute in the autumn of 1²²3 ¹⁰,

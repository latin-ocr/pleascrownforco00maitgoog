NOTES.

Tne first entry is an amercement of two oi the coroners; but in A
this is struck out and alibi is written, for the amercement has been
entered elsewhere, namely, at the beginning ol the civil business.
Perhaps their default (defalta) consisted in not being present at the
opening of the eyre.

1. Bracton says (f. 135 b) that at the beginning of each cyre there must
be an inquiry as to the mode in which Englishry is presented, since the
customs ol different counties are different. Here is one small prool of
his trustworthiness. There is a similar note of the county custom at the
beginning of other lter Rolls.

cervisia is constantly used to mean, not ale, but an ale,a feast,
e. g. a bride-ale. See Skeat, bridal.

socom fecere, to make suit or pursuit.

per sectam Matillidis, at the suit oi Matiida.

l. prepositus, the reeve.

rapus, apparently this was the word in common use sor rape;
Bracton uses raptus. See Du Gangerappus, rapas, etc. Our rape
is not from the Latin rapere (Skeat).

5. invenit hos plegios. Only one pledge is named; probably the
clerk expected a second name. The reader must be prepared for this
sort ol thing.

manucapere aliquem, to take a person in hand, to undertake to
produce him, to become his manucaptor.

6. atteehiars, to take and keep hold of. Aman may be attached by
(per) his goods and chattels, as when they are taken as a security for
his appearance, or by (per) another person who becomes surety sor him.

7. racionabiliter, duly.

8. abjuravit regnum. For the law about sanctuary and abjuration
ol the realm see Bracton (f. 135 b). Abjuration seems to have been
very common.

restari: rettare or retare (sometimes recture), to accuse, generally
supposed to be a word of Teutonic origin: but Diez refers to reputare.
l think that in this roll a man is retlalus when he isos bad lame, although
he bas not been indicted (1'ndr‘clatus),orappealed (appellatus). ln
this case certain persons are rettuli, but the jurors do not believe in
their guilt.

11. This entry has been confused by the intrusion ol a poetscript.
An order is made lor the outlawry of Regem then it appears that two
townships know where heis: then an order is made fur his apprehension.

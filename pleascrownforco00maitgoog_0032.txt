xxviii INT RODUC T ION.

Any one who is willing to take a little trouble, and to remember
that the scribes were listening to English and thinking in English,
will find the Latin of these rolls easy enough ¹.

Now the presentments (vendicta) oi the hundred-jurias are the
lramework ol this record. This should be rememhered, for oeca-
sionally we meet with verbs which have no express subject, such as
dr'cunt, sciunt, nescr‘rmt, malecredunt; it is the J'urors who say, who
suspect, who know or do not know, and if William is suspected
(malecredr'tur) of having killed Roget (de morte Rogerr), it is by the
jurors that he is suspected. In some instanees the presentment is
all that we have eonceming the case, for it leads to nothing; as, lor
instance, when the jurors report that the king has such and such
rights. The Countess of Hereford or the church of S. Nicholas is

’ in the king's gift ; the church is worth so much, the lady's land so
much :-no more can be said ol the matter.

Some entries about crime are os this simple kind. In a
surprising number of cases murderers, robbers, burglars, evil-
doers (murdraloren redoleres, burgalores, malefactores) have come
by night to the house ol such an one and slain everybody in it
The jurors know not who they were, and suspect no one (nascatur
quisuerunt, nullus malecredr'lur). Here there may he nothing to be
done, and occasionally this is noted by the phrase et sileo m'chr'l'.

Then proceeding to entries a little more elaborate, we find many
cases in which the presentruent is immediately followedby an
order os the Court, and, to judge lrom the look os the MSS,
the order was made as soon as this particular presentment was
received. For instance, it may be presented that William lell from
'his horse and was killed, or leli from a boat and was drowned, and ⁴
that no one is suspected ol having killed him. This is adjudged
death by misadventure (sudatum-rhfortunium). But the horse, the
boat, or other the moving thingthat didthemischiel, mustbedevoted,
it is deodand³3 or rather (lor such seems to have been the practice
ol the time) the horse has been sold or appropriated by the sheriff

, ¹ Only one special waming seems necessary. The word sarus simply means
his, theim there is hardly even a presumption in favour ol its being used cor·
rectly. The documeuthas not here been translated, because the only mansiatieur

¹ ,possible wouldbeno more intelligible than the original. Any one who does

uot understand the phrase legemfacerc does not understand the only equivalent
English phrase, to make oru's law.

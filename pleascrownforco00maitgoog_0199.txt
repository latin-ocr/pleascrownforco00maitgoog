This isone of several cases (see ao, 99) in' which an appeai of robbery is

brought to enforce what seems a merely civil claim. The compromise
entered on the civil roll was de omnibus placitis lam de roben'a quam

de assisa. Notice Samuel’s plea that Sibilla is a married woman.
obelo, a coverlet, counterpane3 tela unsa, a liuen clotb;
peplum, awimple? foetura, a towel.

101. This is a striking case. The Bassels‚ hearers of an honourable
name, wounded Geoffrey of Sutton at an ale. He appealed them at the
next county court and then died of his wound. His widow, cristina,
took up the suit and pressed it in two county courts. But theu a' peace
(pax) was made in theold fashion, and seemingly was sanctioned by the
sheriff; there was a marriage aud a marriage settlement. The widow
discontiuued her suit, and John, the son of the dead man, is one of the
jurors who say nothing about it. But it is too late in the day for this
sort of thing; a murder is not a mere wrong. Robert, the only basset
who appears, puts himself on a jury. The jurors and four neighbouring
townships find him guilty and he is hanged. The widow and son of the
dead man make frne. It seenw, from the amercement rolls, that three
other Bassets‚ Geoffrey, John, and fleury, paida fine of 10 marks, and
found pledges for their appearance in case any should appeal them.

The townsbips which try Robert lie at the extreme east of the county,
and Sutton (under Brayles) isa detached bit of Gloucestersbire‚ which is
surrounded by Warwicksbire.

ln the margin of A near the end of this case there are afew mutilated
words3 they seem to be the names of somebody's pledges, and oneof
them is Josephus de Mariscis.

106. Ricardue homo Gaufrldt is outlawed3 Ricardus de la Busseye
makes fine. The latter hadin 1220 paida mark for being bailed out to
twelve men; he had been in prison at Gloucester, under the charge of
having elain Henry le Poer (Excerpt. Rot. Fin. p. 5ο).

110. Post venit et retraxit ee, i. e. Robert the appellor refuses
to go on with the appeal. l now see tbat iu A, William the appellee
makes fine.

The two fragmentary entn'es that follow on this in A relate to (1) a
death by misadventure, and (a) au amercement of the jurors.

111. What in the end happened to the heroine oi this queer talei
bave not been able to discover. She distinctly refused to put herself
upon a Jury, but to all seeming was tried andfound guilty of having com·
passed her husbaud’s death. lt will be observed that she was questioned.
Tbecase is adjoumed to Westminster for judgment3 the same course is
taken in 254· There is a writ (Rot. Claus. vol. i. p. 383) directed to
the judges who went to Kent iu 1218, bidding them adjoum difficult
cases :-‘ You are to decide all easy cases (loquelas planas) which come
before you, but any claims of franchises and other difficult cases (loquelas
arduas) you art to adjourn before our councif (coram consilio nostro)

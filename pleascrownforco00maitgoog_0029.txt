INT RODUC T ION. xxv

county court had sent up to westminster certain knights to make
oral record osa plea. The record, it seems, was false, aud the
knights were arrested. The order is to this effect: let the knights
who are wout to take part in salse judgments, and who are husones
jusanam, be arrested3 and theu two persons are mentioned by ’
name and called husones. It may be then that husones is reallya
word, and that by this title were known those loremost men ol the
county who led the county court and were its mouthpieces.

Every township again was ln theory present before the judges by
its representatives. A township, lor instance, could confess that it
bad sailed in its duties, that it had not presented crimes, or pursued
malefactors or the like, and it could be amerced accordingly. Its
hall corporate character is well illustrated by some strange grammar,
for the word or'llata govems now a singular and now a plural verb.
Some very deep roots os representative government are laid bare
by these eyre rolls.

But it is neither the county nor the township that comes most

prominently forward in this record; the main business was trans·
acted between the judges and juries which represented the several
hundreds. The boroughs¹ and a lew privileged mauors bad jurles

of their own and, as the phrase went, swore by themselves. It
would be an anachronism to call these juries grand juries‚ sor the
petty jury was not yet a permanent institution3 still their chief office
was to present, not to try, though the differente between present-
ment and trial was hardly yet developed Since the Assize ol
Clarendon in 1166 (not to trace their embryonic history) they had
been normal elements in criminal procedure. As to the way in
which they were constituted; it seems that in 1194 lour knights
chosen hythe county chose two knights from each hundred, who
in their turn chose ten others, so as to make with themselves a jury
ol twelve for⁴ the hundred². In Bracton's day the process seems
to bave been much the saure, but a little less elaborate :—the
sery’eant or bailill ol the hundred chose four knights who chose tbe
hundred-jury of twelve⁸. The jury was then sworn to make true

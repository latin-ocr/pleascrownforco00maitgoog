’ and he refused them all. Again, in the two Warwickshire cases

noticed above, a formos trial was apparently adopted of which there
⁸ is no instance in this Gloucestershirc roll; the criminal was held
guilty by the twelve juratores and by twenty-four knights elected ad
doc. It was a time of experimenta and new devices. When Bracton
wrote the form of the inquest had become more fixed; ‘a man,' he
says, ‘may put himself on his country (ραινία), bu't it is notin his
power to choose upon what patrr'a he will put himself ¹.' The
theory that trial by inquest is a royal favour that can be purchased
had apparently become extiuct

But, even when the person to be tried makes no payment for an
inquest, then in this roll the phrase in which he consents to a trial
varies from case to case. He puts himself upon his country (super'
patrnam), upon the vicinage (vermium), upon the oath of the twelve
jurors, and the like. Possibly all these phrases mean the same thing,
for it is noticeable that a change of phrase is often coincident with
a change of handwriting on the roll. There is one clerk, for
example, with a very well marked hand of his own, who constantly
makes express reference to xii juratores and sacramentum xii
juratorum ; in the parts of the roll not written by him these very
phrases seldom occur ². This should serve as a cantion against hasty
conclusions. Clearly the mode of recording crownpleas was not
yet stereotyped. And in whatever words the man submits to trial,
the mode of trial seems much the same. Certain juratores, xr'r'
juratores, say that he is guilty or innocent, if innocent, then he is
acquitted; if guilty, then recourse is had occasionally to the juratores
of another hundred, but more usually to three, or still more usually
to four, neighbouring townships (quotuor vailate proxim: if these

sentence is given.

But, it may be asked, Who are these juratores who, along with the
four townships, finally pronounce aman guilty? Are they the jurors
of the hundred, the presenting-jurors, or is another set of jurors
sworn in to try the particular case? This same question has
exercised readers of Bracton. At the beginning of what he says

again with a few intervals 326-447. The other roll seems almost entirely the
work of one hand, but the phrases iu both vary with the handwriting of A iu a
very noticeable manner. ·

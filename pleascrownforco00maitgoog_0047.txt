INTRODUCTION. xliil

about the eyre Bracton describes the election of the hundred-jury
and the oath that the jurors take, which oath is an oath in general
terms to answer the questions that shall be put to them ¹. Then,
after an interval of many pages, he describes the trial of one who
has put himself upon his country '. Those who try such an one are
duodecim juratores et quatuor villak. Mr. Justice Stephen, while
admitting that the question is very doubtful, thinks that these
sitratorer are not the hundred-jurors, because be thinks that ‘two
distinct occasions are mentioned in which the jurors swear³.’ To
differ from the historian of criminal law is probably to err, but still
this is not quite what Bracton says. When he describes the trial he
says that twelve jurors and four townships being present, each of the
township representatives (quilibet de vallata) is to swear by himself
or all are to swear together. The oath they swear is very much
’ like that taken by the hundred-jurors at the beginning of the cyre.
But nothing seems to be said as to the duodecem juratores swearing a
second time, and the inference suggested is that they are already
sworn. This may leave the procedure of Bracton’s day somewhat
doubtful, but a patient reading of the whole of this record will hardly
leave room for doubt about the practice of 1221. Throughout, the
juratores, duodecem juratores, seem to be the sworn hundredors who
are making answer to the Articles of the Eyre. This does not
involve the conclusion that a man is usually tried by those who have
aheady expressed a belief in his guilt. The hundred-jury is bound ·
to present that a man has been appealed (appellatur) or, more
vaguely, accused (restatur) of a crime, though they themselves do
not think him guilty. In the same breath our record tells us that
juratores declarea man innocent, and that juratores are in mercy for
not having presented the case iu due time ⁴. The petty jury is still
in the future, aud perhaps we should look for its germ in the quatuor
vallate to which recourse is had when the Jicralores say that a man is

fusslfle historians of trial by jury have left almost unnoticed the

part which is played by the four townships in the first half of the
thirteenth century. Their activity has not been traced to any
definite legislation; but it is not unlikely that from of old the
proper legal witnesses to any occurrence were the four neighbour-
ing townships. Thus in the Leges Edwards· Consersorr's⁶ the man

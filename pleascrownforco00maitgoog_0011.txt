INTRODUCTION.

anr is here transcribed is so much ol the record os the
Gloucestershire cyre oi 1221 as relates to pleas ol the crown.
Perhaps it may be welcume, not only to some students ol English
law, but also (ii such a distinction be maintainable) to some stu-
dents oi English history. It is a picture, or rather, since little imagin·
ative art went to its making, a photograph oi English lise as it was
early in the thirteenth century, and a photograph taken srorna
point ol view at which chroniclers too seldom place themselves.
What is thence visible in the sureground is crime, and crime oi a
vulgar kind-murder and rape and robbery. This would be worth
seeing even were there no more to be seen, lor crime is a lact ol
which history must take note, but the political life oi England is in
, a near background. We have here, as it were, a section ol the
body politic which shows just those most vital parts, oi which,
because they were deep-seated, the soul politic was hardly conscious‚
the system of local government and police, the orgariization oi
county, hundred, and township.

It is not indeed supposed that there is anything in this roll
which should startle any one who has learnt the story ol our con-
stitution and the story oi our criminal law from the best modern .·
books, still less any one versed in Bracton’s treatise De Corona,
and such other first-hand authorities as are akeady in print ; but it
is believed that a large stock oi examples‚ given with all their con·
crete details, may serve to provide a body os desh and blood ior the
ancient mles which, whether in the pages oi Bracton or in those of
modern historians, are apt to seem abstract, unreal, impracticable.

For the reason just given this briei preiace will attempt no
general account of the criminal law as it was in the days ol Henry
the Third. The main outlines are well known, while as to details
discussion would as yet be premature; much inore transcrip-
tion will have to be done before such discussion can be sale or

xliv INTRODUCTION.

' who has found stray cattle must show them to the priest‚ the reeve,
and the best menos his township, and then the reeve must send to
the three or iour nearest townships and must disclose the matter to
the priests, the reeves, and best menos those townships. So, in
the books of the thirteenth century ¹, the man who has been injured,
and who is going to bring an appetu, must in the first place raise
hue and cry, and go to the neighbouring townships and declare the
crime; and in the later books the appellor is always made to say
that he at once made suit to the four neighbouring townships².
It may be thus that the four townships became a second body oi
witnesses which could traverse the testimony of the hundred-jury.
At any rate, in the roll before us, in case the twelve jurors think a
rnan guilty, it seems the regular practice to take the opinion oi
three or four vills³, or oi the jurors from another hundred ⁴. In
the Warwickshire roll from this same eyre the recording clerk has
given even greater prominence to the townships, as sometimes
he has stated separately what each os the four ur'llate said. Many
os these matters, about which we now dare give but very hesitating
opinions, will some day be cleared up, when Englishmen begin to
realise the fact that the history of English law, and in particular
the history oi the petty jury, is still in MS. But now it is high time
to speak os the rolls whence this transcript is made.

tershire business of this cyre. Let thern be called Α and B.

150 NOTES.

l have in vain tried to discover the date of this case; it would fix the
date of the last cyre in Glouccstershire.

362. languidus et in Hiera, sick and in a litter.

372. For another case in which Gualo the legate delivered a prisoner
see 294· ln the present case it does not appear that the prisoner was
aclerk.

378. Hugo le Chevaler and Hugo Miles are of course the same
person.

379. The words marked as conjectural are based upon the amerce-
ment roll, p. 135.

beatotum fult vicecomiti, it was testified by the sherill (i).

383. Hemy de Vere had held a gaol delivery (see 374), but when l
do not know. The ordeal of water (juditium aque) was still in use.

394. This case has been transcribed from Α by Palgrave (Common-
wealtb‚ p. clxxxvii), and made known to all by Mr. Justice Stephen
(Hist. vol. i. p. 259). l find that l have supposed mysell to have read
what Sir FrancIs Palgrave leit unread, namely, the interlineation in A,
which seems to be preterquam de orsu. A number ol persons say that
they saw one William kill the other. The four townships attest the
same fact, but cannot say that they actually saw it. The words, il l am
right about them, are of some little interest.

The criminal was taken in the act, holding the weapon with which he
did the deed, so there is no need for him to submit to trial. Indeed
he cannot do so, non potest defindere. Tor similiar cases see 174, 189.

396. The complicated story seems to be this. Walter killed William

· and was outlawed. Walter’s brother Adam was, or was said to have

been, appealed by Jacob and by Martio. Jacob's appeal is backed by
Henry Bigod and Henry Nesse, and Martin's appeal is backed by Hugh
Chark‚ that is to say, these persons were desirous of fighting if Jacob or
Martin died or made default. (As to contingent and supplementary
appeals of this kind see Bracton, i. r 383 evidently the phrase si deas.
male contigerat was the technical phrase properio be used in such sub·
sidiary appeals). When, however, it comesto the point, Jacob with-
draws his appeal, confessing it was groundless lle has to pay a fine of
40¹ and find twelve sureties that he will keep the peace. His backers,
the two Henries, do not appear, and a capias goes against them. Then
Martio denies that he ever appealed Adam; the coroners’ rolls, how·
ever, show that he did, and the order is that he and his backer Hugh he
kept iu custody. Then, however, the county contradicts the coroners
and says that Martio never appealed Adam, and so Martia (the rolls
say Walter, but this is a mistake) and Hugh go quit. lt is noticeable
that the judges believe the county rather thau the coroners’ rolls; as to
this see Bracton, f. 140b.

As to Adam, there is now no appeal against him, but he pays a sub-
stantial sum lor an inquest and is acquited. Seem'ingly he is tried by
the twelve jurors of Blidesloe, the same jurors who are amerced for not
having presented the appeals. What would have happened to him if he
had not made the paymenti lt seems probable that the testimony of

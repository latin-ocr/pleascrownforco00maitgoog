INTRODUCTION. xxix

or some other officer, the jurors then present its value (precium equi
r'u sel), and an order is made that the officer must account sor this
(rende vicecomes respondeat). The judges seem to have had the
power to direct payment ol such moneys to pious uste, and the
order sometimes is that they be given ior God (dentur pro deo)
to the building of some church‚ or to the children ol the dead man,
since they are poor, or the like ¹. Perhaps the officer has already

paid, and then the entry ends with reddedit et que‘etus, ‘he has pald
and is quit!

Or again, William has been slain; the jurors suspect Roget, who
has fled (Rogerus sugit p'ro morte itta et malecrede'tur), and they

suspect no one else (nullus atres matecrede'tur). On this there yill
at once follow the order that Roger is to be demanded or exacted
or put in exigent in the county court and thereupon outlawed
(e‘reterrogetur et allegetur, or, exr'gatur et utlugetur'). A woman
would not be outlawed‚ sor she never is in the law; she would
be waived (maturare), but the result would be much the same; and
according to Bracton, in Gloucester and Herelord‚ shires near to the
turbulent Welsh march, any one may lawlully kill an outlavv even
though the outlaw makes no resistance. But having fled lora
crime Roger's chattels are forfeited. What were they worth and
who possessed himself of them? The answer is given by such
phrases as nullo catallo trebuetur catallo eyies vsot. rende ve'cecomes
respondeat, unde Adam filius Negelle‘ respondeat, unde vallata de
Cherletone respondeat,· the sheriff, or Adam Fitz Neal (one ol the
coconem), or the township oi Chariton, has had the chattels and
must answer for their value.

Then ina case oi homicide there isgenerally another thing to be
considered. Is it amurder (murdrum)? for, it so, a fine (murdrum)
is due from the hundred. The word murder is never used to
differentiate two degrees of homicidal guilt, it merely means that
the slayer has not been caught and that Englishry has not been
presented. In accordance with the famous rule enforced by
William the Conqueror, the hundred in which a foreigner is slain is
fined if the slayer is not produced ⁸, and in some way or another

the strange doctrine has become established that every one is to be
deemed aforeigner unless his Englishry (Engtesctera) is proved.
That can only be proved by his kinssollr, and Bracton says that the
rule as to how many kinsmen must testisy varies from county to
county¹. In Gloucestershire proos has to be given by two males
on the lather's side, and one on the mother's side ; no woman is
admitted ². Seemingly the prooi is originally given before the
coroners in the county court, and then in the eyre the jurors pre-
sent this prool and produce the original provers (presentatum) il
they be alive. The judges decide perhaps that all due forms have
been observed, or perhaps that Englishry has not been duly pre·
seuted (Englascbertir nan est racionabiliter presentata), and in the
latter case it is adjudged murder (judicata-murdrum). The
amount ol the'line to be imposed on the hundred is a matter to be
considered at the end of the eyre. Many lords have charters which
exempl their lands irom murder fines, they hold their lands quit ol
murders (terras qui‘etas de omnibus murdrtt), so that this fine is
exacted from the hundred excepting these franchises (de hundreda
exceptri- libertatibus). Towns also such as London³ and Gloucester‘
have charters which exempt them from murdra, and we learn that
there are no murders in that part of Gloucestershire which is vvest
os the Severn (nan jacet murdrum ultra Sabrinam Ι.)

We learn also that, at least in this shire, it was not law to take
a murder fine for an accidental death. Engelard used to doit,
but clearly this is regarded as a lawless actt. This isos some
interest. In Bracton’s day⁷ it was the custom in some counties that
death by misadventure would give rise to a murdrum it Englishry
was not presented, and apparently between 1221 and ¹²47 this
custom established itseli in Gloucestershire⁸. Alittle later and this
became an important question, one worth a parliamentary struggle.
Our final adoption of the principle that misadventure is not murder

is proximately due to a severe winter, that ol 1257-8. There was ⁸

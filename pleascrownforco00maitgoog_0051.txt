INT RODUC T ION. xlvii

The most plausible theory therefore as to the relation between
these two rolls is, that neither was copied from the other, but that
the two were kept by clerks sitting side by side, whose duty it was
to produce records persectly harmonious about all matters of
importance. The spelling of a local name was of no importance;
whether one should write exr'gatur or r‘rrlerrogetur was of no im-
portance: but it was of great importance that the rolls should
agree about the very words of witnesses‚ parties, jurors.

With regard to the postscripts it should be observed that, with
one exception (an account of duels at Hereford and Worcester,
found in B but not in ΑΙ), nothing has been written on the roll of
crown pleas that may not have been written in Gloucestershire.
Among the civil pleas there area few cases of later postscripts
from Hereford, Worcester, and even from Westminster. Asarule,
however, there seems to have been no attempt to ‘maire upa
record,’ i.e. to present continuously the successive stages of each
case. Only what happens in Gloucestershire is put on this toll,
thoughit may be no more than that the parties are adjourned
to Hereford or to Westminster.

There is therefore little to choose between these two rolls. But
on the whole A, though mutilated‚ seems· rather the more worthy
to be the subject of a transcript ln the lirst place it gives us, and
B does not, the list of amercements, which is of great value, if we
are to have a complete picture of the eyre; and in the second
place the main part of this roll has apparently been used in the
drawing up of this list of amercements. In A there are not a few
cases in which the text states that so and so is in mr'serr‘cordrir, and·
the abbreviation ὦ is duly entered in the margin ; but afterwards
apen has been drawn through this symbol, and occasionally a
reason is given why there is to be no amercement: the person
is dead (ebrii), or is poor (pauper), or is pardoned (perdonatur), or,
for some reason or another, is not to be lined (m‘chr'l). These
marks and notes are much more frequent in Α than in Β and
suggest that, when the time for assessing the amercements carne, the
former roll was used as the basis of the work and the body of that
roll was brought into hannony with the list of amercements by a
process of correction. So again postscripts are more cornmon in
Athan iu B; for instance, when both rolls have told us that John is

’ tobekept in custody (custodrhtur)‚Awill add that afterwards he made

fine (finemsecif) ; apparently therefore Abas been posted 'up to the
¹ 87; see also 274, which perhaps records a payment made st westminster.

142 NOTES.

(which town was certainly revisited) between George and Estmar. But
this is obscure, because, according to the roll, Thomas is again the com·
batant. George is again victorious, and his enemy is blinded and
mutilated.

Possibly the story does not end here though the record does. Under
this very year 1221 the Worcester annalist reports how barbarism was
tempered by miracle. A certain champion (pugil), by name Thomas of
Eldersfield, wasblinded and mutilated, but rendered whole and sound by
S. Wulstan. He then became protessed and lived long and honourably3
whence the verse,

Sexu privatus fit vir; ridet exoculatus.

The Tewkesbury annalist tells the sarne story under the same year.
Probably, however, it relates to sorne champion (pugil) in a writ of
right; but atleast the case belongs to this eyre. S. Thomasi Becket had
worked avery similar miracle; the story has lately been told by Mr.
Justice Stephen (Hist. vol. i. p. 78). lt may be that these horrible
sentences were not always very punctually obeyed. The allusion in the
margin of B to the Assize of Clarendou is not very intelligible; but as
to loss of hand and foot see Assize of Northampt0n‚ sec. 1.

89. Elvt'na gets back the bundle (saccus, fardellum) of stolen goods,
because the thies was still selsed of them when he was killed; probably
if the thiel had waived thern, cast thern away in bis llight, they would
have belonged to the king. As to the lawfulness of lrilling a thief com-
pare this case with 53, 362.

tuus latrooinium: the words latrocim‘um and firrtum osten
stand for the stolen goods.

92. Observe these heavy fines inflicted when there was death by mis-
adventure.

96. bebelius, a boat.

99. An appeal of robbery: the substantial defence is, I am your
landlordand took the goods in distress (in namium). It would probably,
however, be a mistahe to suppose that this appeal‚ which is very
lilre No. πο, is adjudged null on the ground that the appellee took the
goods undera belief that he had a right to take them. The appeal is
adjudged null on proof of what happened in the county court, namely,
that the goods having been replevied, the appellor had sued for damages,
counting on the sherili's peace and only referred to the king's peace when
it had already been adjudged that the appellee might maire his law iu
proos oi his not having detained against gage and pledge (contra vadium
et plegium). The decision in this case and in No. ao is not that
the appellee has not stolen, but that he has not been duly appealed.
This is an early account ot repleviu proceedings County court pro·
cedure was not expeditious.

100. This case was compromised by leave of the court. ln the civil

part ol the roll (A. memb. 6 dors.) there is the record of an assiae of
novel disseisin brought by this Samuel against' this Sibilla. The question
really was whether oue Serio had enfeoffed his younger son Gilbert
(Sibilla's late husband) while his elder son Sarnuel was in Palestine.

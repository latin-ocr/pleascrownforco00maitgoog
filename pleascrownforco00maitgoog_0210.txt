This is a fine for beaupleader, pro pulchre placitando. These lines
became a great popular grievance. At the Parliament of Oxford com-
plaint was made against them :-‘ justiciarii capiunt linem gravem pro
pulchro placitando de quolibet comitatu ne occasionetur.' Probably the

measure above its brim, now they only fill the measure to the level of
the brim; this new practice was begun in the days of Peter of Chanceaux,
constable of Bristol.

Compare the assiae of measures in Hoveden, vol. iv. p. 33: ‘et

sor making mistakes oi many kinds. The abbreviated words are
very numerous, and the clerks in their haste have made great use
not only oi the regular stenographic signs, each os which has a
specilic meaning, but also of the indiscriminating dash, which, when
drawn over the end ol a word, may stand lor almost any termina·
tion. It is not improbable that in many cases these have been mis·
interpreted, especially when the abbreviated word is the name ol a
place. To make a first-rate copy of such a roll as this would
require knowledge of many kinds, grammatical‚ etymological, his·
torical, geographical, antiquarian, to which l can make no claim (el
ideo in mihericordia); it must be enough if l have not misrepresented
matters os law.

The abbreviated words written in the margin oi theron have not

. been expanded, but have been printed in what is something like

their original iorm. These abbreviations are easily intelligible. The
chiel are these :-

rr'ria, mic, = misericordia, miscricordie; some person or persons is
or are to be ameroed.

trffis = transgressio ; some one has committed a trespass, or rather
a misdemeanour ¹. Ι

ad jud = ad judicium; a judgment is to be given against some
one.

cap = capiatur; some one is to be taken into custody.

custod = custodiatur; some one is to he kept in custody.

exig, utlag, utdu—s, = exigatdr, utlagetur, utlagandus; some one
is to be put in exigent arrd outlawed.

abjur = abjuravit; some one has abjured the realm.

loq = loquendum3 the matter must be further discussed.

d'o‘ dand = deodandum; something is deodand.

m'dr=murdrum, a murder.

When one os these marginal notes is printed within brackets,
thus [cap], this means that apen has been drawn through the note
in the original. ln the text the printing of a word in italics means
that l am more than usually doubtful oi its correctness; the printing
ol a word in italics and within brack'ets means that it is conjectured
to supply the place of a word wholly or partially lost or by me
illegible. There being two MSS, which generally agree verbatim,
little has been left unread3 but there are a lew very obscure inter-
lineations in A.

¹ The iramgressio oi this time is mihera small crime than a civil injury.

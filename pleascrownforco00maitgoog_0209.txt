and day in the felon’s land, and that the land is to be given up to the.
Abbot oi Gloucester, the felon’s lord. ln 454 there is another escheat
01 land propter delictum tenentis. Now it is a question 01 some little
importance whether land in Gloucester would escheat propter delicium,
because this bears on avery interesting and unsolved problem in our
legal history, the origin and value 01 the so·called statute, Prorogativa
Regis. According to that document (cap. 16) it is said (dictim) that
the lands 01 lelons in Gloucester (the English translation says in the
county 01 Gloucester, but the Latin text does not bear this out) do not
escheat, andin Kent, ‘the father to the bough, and the son to the plough!
As to Kent, it it is well known that the exception became admitted
law (Hale, P. C. 101. i. p. 3⁶0)· ln some way or another Kentisimen suc·
ceeded in persuading the judges that they had many peculim customs
01 their own, e. g. that there was no villeinage in Kent. But 1 am not
aware that any' notice has ever been pald to what is said in the Prorog-
ait'va about Gloucester. lt will not be out 01 place to add that this
would-he statute refers, for the sake 01 illustration, to two cases that
must have happened iu Henry the Third’s reign. The one concerns John
01 Moumouth, who wasone oi the judges at Gloucester in 1221, the
other concertis Anselm Marshall, the youngest son 01 the great earl, and
the brother 01 the William hlarshall who was at Gloucester in 1221. The
Prerogativa would well repay a careful investigation.

452. The town 01 Gloucester has to answer 101 this escape from its
gaol, 101 the gaol is its gaol, since Walter Long the keeper 01 it is not
the owner, and has no fee in his office. The gaola ville is different
from the casinam domini regis (435).

453. How did the Earl lilarshall come by these chattelsi Does the
story go bach to his shrievalty?

459. The castellans 01 Gloucester used, 011 the first day for the sale 01
beer, to take 18 gallons (lagenam) from every brew, paying two-pente
for them: they either paid the money down, or gavea tally (talliis, dria)
for it, and so long as the tally remained in the hands of the woman, (for
of course the person who brews is a woman) they could take no more
beer from her. But Rochlord introduced the practices 01 taking two·
pence when he took no beer, 01 taking beer on the last day as well as on
the first day 01 sale, and 01 taking beer from those who still held out·
standing tallies.

461. The charier 01 Henry the Second, granting this watercourse, is
printed in the Chartulary of Gloucester Abbey (Rolls' series), voi. i. p.
155; see also vol. 11. p. 186 101 a (i) grant 01 the same by William the
Conqueror.

465. As to the coroners, see above, 4¹²· Apparently the town of
Gloucester has no coroners 01 115 own; Bristol has.

datur: see 189.

471. Robert osRoppelay, whose heir answers for chattels here and in
481, had been constable 01 Bristol before Gerard 01 nihte3 he was
superseded in 1208: sec also 503.

INTRODUCTION. ' xli

guilty did not come with open minds to the investigation oi evidence

given by others; they themselves were the witnesses; their verdict Ι

was their sworn testimony. Sometimes perhaps they, or some
oi them, had really seen the crime, more often their knowledge
must have been inferential, and we shall meet with some curiously
argumentative verdicts¹. Occasioually other persons who are not
jurors give evidence ¹, and it seems that the accused himself was
sometimes questioned ³. The evidence oi these other persons is
mentioned along with the evidence or the verdict (call it which we
will) of the jurors ⁴ 3 this body ol testimony is the case against the
prisoner, and it is by no means certain that the judges were bound
to accept what the jurors said as periectly conclusive ⁸. In some
cases, however, we seem to see a rudimentary distinction between
testimony and verdict. Apparently the judges occasionally pressed
the jurors for an exact answer to the question, ‘ guilty or not guilty!
This seems the explanation os the phrase, which osten occurs,
‘juratores precise debunt quod est culpabilis, quod non est culpabilis?
They are pressed precise dicere, to answer Yes or No ⁰.

Next it should be noted that the trying body or body ol swom
testifiers, was variously constituted. Occasionally a person pays
money to the king that he may have an inquest ⁷, and it would seem
that he might still buy the right to be tried by a body constituted in
some particular way. He might pay to be tried by the jurors of
two hundreds‚ or of three hundreds ⁸, and because oi local enmities
such a payment may sometimes have been expedient. The section
os the charter⁹ which declared that a writ of inquest touching iiie
and members should be granted gratuitously was not construed as
forbidding the receipt oi such payments. Then again we are told
in one case that the defendant would not put himself upon the oath
of the twelve jurors, nor upon the county, nor upon a jury oi any

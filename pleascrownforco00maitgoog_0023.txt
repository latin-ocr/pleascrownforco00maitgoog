preserved for us records of the pleas, both civil a'nd criminal, heard
at Woroester, Warwiclr, and Shrewshury¹, while for Gloucestershire
we have not merely a record, but two records. This by itsell
would be a reason for the choice that we have made. But there is
afurther reason; the doings of Gerard and Engelard have made
the Gloucester rofls more various and more interesting than those
of the other three counties. The somewhat monotonous catalogue
of common crimes due to greed and jealousy, to lust and beer, is
here diversified by the exactione of the foreign sheriffs, and mere
social history is enlivened by a touch of politics. But if it be hut
luck that sends us to Gloucester, still the lothes fallen to us in
a fair ground. There is less need to speak of place than of time.
The year 1221 is gone for ever, the county of Gloucester is where
it always was ¹, and hardly a name of village or hamlet is mentioned
in this roll that cannot be found, perhaps a little clipped and
twisted, on the modern ordnance map. Still we may just note that
the great shire which joins Warwick to Somerset, and Berks to
Monmouth, is a good specimen county. There is land of every
kind, the Cotswolds, the SevernValley, the wild Forest of Dean,
while, in the thirteenth century, there was hardly a county with two

such towns as Gloucester and Bristol ³.
It would be well could we determine exactly how long a time had

passed since there was lastaneyreinGloucestershire. On theanswer
to this question must depend the meaning of this roll as a record
of crime. What length of time was it that produced, for example,
this abundant crop of murders? It will soon be apparent that the

inquiry was carried back a long way. fn caseafter case presented

With these were joined two other regular judges of the king's
court, Robert Lexington (another ecclesiastic) 3ηά Ralph Hareng.
The list ends with John of Moumouth, 3 baron powerful in the
west, 3 good servant of King John, an executor of his will.

Itis not improbable that among the clerks who recorded the
proceedings of the court was a lawyer whom Bracton esteemed
second to none but the great Martin. A Warwiclrshire roll has
been preserved which belongs to this eyre ¹. At the very foot of
one of its parchments its scribe has written without context what
can hardly be other than his own name, Will‘. de Raleg'. William
Raleigh, as judge, minister, bishop, had along and stormy career
before him Famous in many ways, the number of his judgments
cited by Bracton, 3ηά the vast importance of Bracton's boolr,
entitle him to be called one of the main fashioners of the common
law.

While we are speaking of men, there are some others of a dif-
ferent kind who should be mentioned, for they are often named in
this roll. The best commentary on their names is a section in the
first edition of the ¹Great Charter². ‘We,’ the king is made to say,
‘will utterly put out from their bailiwicks the kinsmen (parentes) of
Gerard of· Athee, that henceforth they may have no bailiwiclr in
England‚ Engelard of Cigogne, Andrew, Peter, Gio of Chanceaurr,
Gio of Cigogne‚ Geofsrey of Martigny and his brothers, Philip
Marlr 3ηά his brothers and Geoffrey his nephew, and their whole
following (sequelam).’ They were foreign adventurers, the instru-
ments of John’s misrule. Several of them will corne before us, for
Gio of Chanceaux had held Tewlresbury and Peter of Chanceaux
had held Bristol; but our chief concern is with Gerard of Athee
and Engelard of Cigogne, both sheriffs of Gloucestershire.

Gerard of Athee (if all that was said of him be true) wasa

villein, his father and mother were villeins, his lord was the lord of ¹

Amboise³3 Athee, Cigogne, Chanceaux are in Touraine, between
Amboise and Loches. Some now forgotten exploits of border war-
fare may have raised this base-bom man above his seuov-sers.

The first thing told of him is that on the death of King Richard,
when the question was what should be John's and what Arthur's,

different version of the clause 5 it mentions Gerard's wife and children.

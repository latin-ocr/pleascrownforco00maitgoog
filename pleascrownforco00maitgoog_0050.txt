xlvl INTRODUCTION.

when the erasing lmife has been used on the one it has sometimes
been used orr the other also.

But while the agreement about words is generally perfect, in
spelling there is great divergence. This may be noticed even in
common words¹ ; but as to names of places in no way famous
the two rolls as often as not disagree about the spelling of thern,
aud sometimes the variance is very marked indeed. Apparently
the scribe of each roll was in this matter quite dependent on
his ear. -

Again, the verbal agreement is not perfect. Generally it is quite
perfect in the report of any story, whether told by jurors or litigante,
and for some most curious turns of phrase we have the authority
of both rolls. On the other hand, in the common forms of
judgment and the lilre there is habitual but immaterial divergence;
thus one clerlr will, for a while, steadily write judicium murdrum, the
other, et ideo murdrum ,· one, exigatur et utlagetur, the other, emer·
rogetur et rulogetur,¹ in Athe phrase de nocte is very common, in
B it is almost always represented by noctu.

But from time to time the divergence between the two goes
beyond these small matters One roll will supply some fact or
some bit of reasoning not to be found in the other, and though iu
general it is Α that gives the fuller report, still this is not always the
case, and B occasionally supplies what is laclring in A.

Lastly, there are some instances in which the order of the entries
in A differs from that in B. Among the pleas of the crown this is
mostly found in connection with a statement that the jurors are in
mercy for concealing pleas (pro concelomento loquelarum), and it
looks as if each clerlr had introduced the belated presentments
where he could best find room. ln the parts of the rolls which
contain civil pleas there seems to be still greater disagreement
asto the order in which the cases shall be introduced, and it is not
improbable that the introductory matter of the cases which were
going to be heard was sometimes written down before the proceed-
ings in court took place; thus the clerlr had mapped out his roll
by writing eg. ‘the assiae comes to testify whether William
disseised Roger; the jurors say,' before the jurors had said
anything, and then, as the jurors brought in their testimouies,
the gaps which had been left were frlled up.

¹ The spelling in B is curious; more thau once, e. g. it has parientes for
parentes.

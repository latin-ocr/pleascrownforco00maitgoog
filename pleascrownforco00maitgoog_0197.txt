NOTES. 141

pledge, has a lord who will narrant him (qui ipsum advocaverit), and
is willing to put himself on his country that he is a true man. Si autem
in decem non suerit nec dommum labuerit qui advocet eum, et
patriam recusavm't‚sotie tuncrum omnia bona ei deficiant, et per hoc
par sit appellanti, procedat i'nier eos duellum. In Bracton’s time this
rule, that a man appealed hyan approver may go to the country instead
of fighting, was seemingly a survival, since every appellee had choice he-
tweeu the two modes of trial; but in 1221 this rule about an approver's
appeal may still have been au exception to the general rule that an
appellee must light.

plegius eorum gaola, let the gaol be their bail; this isa neat
phrase in common use.

The marginal notes which seem to show that Philip began his three
appeals in three different counties are from B. I do not think that
they were in Α.

The date oi the duel was the fifth oi July.

75. quatuor ulnas ds biancheto, four ells of blanket.

defendit . . .. sieut latronem ligatum, he denies in the form
proper to a case in which the appellor is a thiel in bonds. See Bracton,
f. 1²3 b, ei B venit et defendit societatem et latrocinium ettotam
. . . . sicul versus eum, quiesi latro ei cognoscem.

76. per odium et stiuam, of hatred and mallee : aliia is our late.

This appeal faiis at every point, so that one cannot say whether the
appellor's coverture was a fatal obJ'ection; see 100.

78. herote, a harrow3 heroine, to harrow.

79. gualo, a page, a groom.

ugaratare, exsertare, to hamstring; ci. garier.

81. Robert of Gotherington‚ who is acquitted of this crime, had been
arrested and imprisoned at Gloucester; iu 1219 he paid a mark to the
king and was bailed out to twenty-four lawful men oi the county
(Excerpt. Rot. F in. vol. i. p. 34).

83. st villata cognovit, and the township confessed that they did
not raise hue aud cry, and that no suit was made to the hundred court,
and that they did not report the matter to the coroners.

87. At the outset a question arises as to whom George has appealed as
priucipal (de jacto) and whom as accessory (dc vi). lt is proved that he
has all along appealed Thomas as principal and Estmar as accessory. A
variance ln this matter would have been fatal to the appeal (Bracton,
i.141); but there has been none. Then George wants to pursue his
appeal asa maimed man (as to this see Bracton, f. 142-143); but the
court decides that he is not maimed. Seemingly Thomas wants to be
tried by the country; the jurors think him guilty, and it is adjudged that
there must be a duel at Hereford on the arst of July. Then B adds
what happened at Hereiord; Thomas was vanquished, blinded,aud muti-

lated. An order was then made ior the productiori of Estmar the
accessory. He was to he produced at Gloucester‚ which town perhaps
the judges revisited on their return from Hereford. Then follows inB

another postscript, which perhaps tells the story ola duel at Worcester

. Gerard helped to secure for John the strongholds of Chinon and
Loches ¹. ln 1202 war broke out between John and Philip ; Tours
was taken by Philip, retalren by John, and committed by John to
Gerard’s keeping¹. Thenceforward Gerard was John's seneschal in

Touraine⁸. He treated his own native land so ill as to give a
French chronicler cause to remember that a foe of one's own
household is the worst of foes and a slave the worst of tyrants⁴.
The war went against John; but when almost all else was lost,
Gerard was still defending Loches with ferocious braveryt Loches
fell and Gerard was made prisoner ⁶. But John now wanted him
in England and paida great ransom for him, seemingly two
thousand marks; but Gerard was cheap at the price ⁷.

To England he came in ¹²07 with his kinsmen and companions
in anns, Andrew‚ Peter, and Gio ol Chanceaux, and Engelard of
Cigogne. A Hampshire manor was at once given to these last to
support them in the king's service ⁸. On Gerard himself favours
were poured. He must have been a man after John’s own heart.
Within a few months the county and castle of Gloucester, the
castlc of Bristol, the lands of the see of Bath, the castle and
county of Hereford, the wide honour of Gloucester, were put in
his keeping⁹. During the interdict the churches of the west felt
his hand heavy upon them²⁰. He disseised Cirencester Abbey of
its seven hundreds²¹, he robbed the very lepers ol Bristol¹¹. He
was let fly for higher game than moniis or lepers. When John
wished to strike down William of Braose, Gerard was the man
employed for the work ¹³. The place that his name basin the
charter will tell how the barons hated him. They did not forget
his servile birth; they spoke of his sequela, a word by which one
describes the family, if family it may be called, ol avillein. But
from the very words oi the charter we may gather that he was
already beyond their power. He is last mentioned asa living man

lreep the peace! The whole document, with its division of crimes
into gravebra, medab, mahero, is very untechnical, and leaves a great

deal to judicial discretion. This gives the eyre rolls of the next “

years a great and special importance.

It will be observed that not one word is said about putting such
accused persons upon their trial. In the case of grave crime and .
grave suspicion they are to be imprisoned ; but this imprisonment
is merely the safe custody of persons who are suspected, not the
punishment of persons who have been tried and found guilty.
This suggests that there was felt to be injustice in trying a man by
his neighbours unless he had consented to be so tried. It is well
known that, at alater date, this idea blossomed out into the pedantic
cruelty of the ‘peine forte et dure ¹,' and Dr. Brunner has shown
that this same idea was at work both in Normandy andin other
parts of France⁸. It has long been known, however, that in this
matter, as in many others, English law became more pedantic as
English lawyers became more professional, and it has long been
suspected that at least some judges, in the early part of Henry the
Third’s reign, saw no insuperable objection in the way of trying a
man who distinctly refused to be tried. The ground for this
suspicion has been a note by Emlyn in Hale's Pleas of the
Crown³. From the Warwickshire roll of this very eyre, that of
1221, he produced two cases; in each it is recorded very plainly
that the accused non uult ponere se super patrzbm, whereupon
twenty-four knights chosen adhoc endorse the accusation made by
the twelve hundredors, and the accused is hanged. Thus did the
Abbot of Reading and Martin Pateshull in the county of Warwiclt3
what they did in the county of Gloucester may be seen below.
There are seven instances of an accused person declining to be
tried and these are dealt with in a manner that is provolringly
incouclusive; possibly the judges were only feeling their way
towards the principle upon which they most undoubtedly acted
when they got to Warwickshire. , Apparently the aecused gets just
the same trial that be would have had if be had put himself on his
country, and if the evidence is conclusive against him he is hanged3
but, unless itis quite conclusive, be is left in prison or allowed to
abjure the realm or even suffered to find bail ⁴.

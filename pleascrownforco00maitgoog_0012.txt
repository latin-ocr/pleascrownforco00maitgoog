profitable. Some explanatione of particular cases and phrases have
been placed at the end of this book. The rolls themselves, and
the mode in which they have been copied, shall be described here-
31133. Here it is proposed to recall some facts about the year 1221
which should be bad in mind if the best use is to be made of our
document.

First as to legal literature. In 1221 more than thirty years had
passed since the writing of the book which bears the name of
Ranulf Glanvill, and somewhat more than thirty years were yet to
come before Bracton's book would be written. Our roll is one of
the earliest that Bracton cites ; the time to which¹ he looked back
as to a golden age of jurisprudence was just beginning, and llfartin
Pateshull, the hero of his book, was among the judges who sat at
Gloucester¹.

. Again, this was the first cyre held in Gloucestershire since the
abolition of the ordeal. We thus catch sight of trial by jury at a
most interesting and critical moment of its development.

A greater number of remembrances may be called up by saying
that this was the first eyre in Gloucestershire after the grant of the
great Charter. The Charter‚ it will be remembered, was sealed on ·

15th June, 121'52. John did not mean to lreep it; the Pope, once

his enemy, but now his liege lord and best friend, absolved him from
his oath, and in the autumn of the same year the war broke out ³.
That war lasted on and off for just about two years. Our roll will

often mention this tempus guerre ⁴, but not perhaps quite so often as ,

we might expect, did we not know that the western counties were
not the scene of much serious fighting. John's grip on them was

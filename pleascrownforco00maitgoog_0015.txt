seven judges was what we should call a very strong commission,
and seemingly all of them were men who had either served John
well in his evil hour or at least had taken no overt part against
him ; they did not belong to the baronial party ².

The first judge named in the commission was Simon, Abbot of
Reading. He must have been an able, intrepid man, otherwise
Innocent the Third would not have chosen him to publish the
sentence of excommunication against the champions of the charter⁸.
The second name is that of Randolf, Abbot of Evesham. It is
not known that either of these prelates was by profession a lawyer,
or was ever employed as a royal judge save on this one occasion ⁴.
But the book to which we most naturally look for an account of Abbot
Randolf reminds us that at this time a monastic life was by no
means incompatible with a zealous study and practice 01 the law ⁸.
The Abbey of Evesham had several suits to prosecute and defend
before the judges at Gloucester, and likely enough was represented
by its prior, Thomas Marlborough, who was to succeed Randolf in
the abbotcy. The lively chronicle that he has left us shows him to

school at Oxford⁸ 3 he gave his monastery a library of law-books3
lor years he fought the Bishop of Worcester from court to court;

that he might plead it better he went to Bologna to hear the lectures
01 Azo, that ‘master 01 311 masters of the law,' in whose books
Bracton found many things that he made law for England ⁷. In the
keen delight of successful advocacy he has told us how his too
fluent adversary bored the pope with tedious argument, and how the

¹40 NOTES.

53. As to hilling a thies taken in the act, compare this case with 89
and 362. William did not dare to face the legal consequences olbis
'act3 perhaps he had not caught the thies hand-haring. Robert the
parson (persona) cannot be amerced because he is dead.

59. carpenum, lantpertum, canipulum, a knife; it is the English
kmse and F rencb canifi

62. archa, a chest, box.

68. The ways which'the parson straitened (estreciavit) were not
the king’s high ways, so there was no purpresture or encroachment on
the king's rights, consequently no plea of the crown. Dicitur autem
purprestura vel porprestura proprie, quando aliquid super dominum
regern injuste occupatur, Glanvill‚ lib. ix. cap. 11.

69. Fleta (l. 53, 54) says that awoman can bring an appeal lor the
death of her unboru child; Britton (vol. i. p. 114) says that she cannot.
See also Eracton, l. 121, and Stephen, Hist. vol. iii. p. 32· Sir S.
Clarke, in his notes on the first book of F leta, p. 82, cites a roll of 45
Henry3 in favour of such an appeal. Clarke’s (anonymous) book is
too little known.

71. ln Α there has been a great deal ot' correction and interlineation.
Seemingly the appeal was lirst brought by John Robertsom or, at
least, the clerk supposed that he was the appellor; but theu for his
name that of Nicholas Parent hasbeen substituted, and consequent but
obscure alterations hare been made in the description of the goods.
The truth seems to be that Nicholas was in the house as John Robert-
son’s sarmer, and as such was the proper person to prosecute an appeal
of robbery, even though some os the goods belonged to John, for the
appeal must be brought by the possessor whether owner or not (see
Holmes, Common Law, p. 168). Martin Ball, the appellee, first tra-
verses the whole charge and theu pleads that he was acting as servant oi
the Abbot of Evesham, that the Abbot was eutitled to possession of the
house, and that John Robertson bas brought an assize of novel disseisin
which is pending. The appeal is adjudged null; the assiae will give
John the chattels if he is eutitled to them (Glanvill, xiii. 9). lt seems to
have been no uncommon thing to attempt to use the appeal of robbery
sor the purpose os trying title to land. See roo.

de forcia. The accessories oi a principat criminal are his vis and
his forcia; to appeal a person de sacto is to accuse him as principat, to
appeal him de vi or de sarcia is to accuse him as accessory (see 87).
. The appeal against the principat does not lie (non jacet).

10⁰¹ in denariis, ten marks in cash.

jocalia, jewels.

73. Philip is an approver (probator); he is a conlessed thiel and
appeals three other persons (see 74, 75) of complicity in his crimes.
The tirst of these is William, and since William is not in frantpteuge,
has no lord to answer sor him and simply denies the charge, be is forced
to fight Philip. The case gives a good proof of Bracton’s fidelity to his
authorities. He says (f. 152) that a man appealed by an approver oi

participation in thelt or otper selony need not fight tf he is in trank-

INT RODUC T ION. xxxv

sureties or bail required for all manner of purposes‚ especially for
the productiori ofa suspected person, if hereafter any one shall
accuse him ; A de B dat domim> regi fres marcas per plegium Cde
D uf possr'f esre sub plegio standi recto siquis versus eum loqui volu-
erit, plegii q'us Cde D, E de F, etc.; the sureties that he will pay

the mark, and the sureties that he will stand to right (stare recto), Ι

must be distinguished¹: in case of an appeal it will be the duty of
the latter habere eum, i. e. to produce him in court, or they will be
in mercy quia non habuerunt quem plegr'aoerunf. They have under-
taken, taken in hand (in manum ceperunt), to produce him.

As to the amount of crime that there has been very accurate
statistics must not be expected, for it is clear that the same case is
sometimes presented by more than one jury, and there are other
obvious difficulties in the way ofa precise computation. Still it
seems that some 250 persons bave met their deaths by what
would now be called murders. In an extremely small number of
cases is any one brought before the judges and accused of the
murder, in a still smaller number is any one hanged; indeed the
amount of hanging done is really trivial. Only from a series of
transcripts such as the present, canwe ever learn whether this state
of things was normal, bnt unfortunately it is easier to make theories
of sociology than to ascertain facts. However it would seem from
this roll that we ought not to make much allowance because of the
then recent war, for apparently all that had been done in the way
of fair fighting was not reckoned crime and was covered hythe
Lambeth treaty. ligatio, it must be remembered that the statement
of the jurors that unknown evil-doers have slain this and the other
person is often a statement against interest and therefore credible,
for if there has been a murdrum the 'hundred which the jurors re-
present must pay for it. For the more part the crimes are the crimes
of plunderers ; a gang of robbers breaks a house, alays, and steals.
Two other remarks may occur to us: first, that stabbing is a very
common crime, the Englishrnan carries a knife (mapulam), and on
occasion uses it ; secondly‚ that the English beer, of which Pope
innocent spoke, had worse effects than that of inspiring unsound
opinions about prescription.

comparatively few as are the cases in which an accused cri-
minal is brought before the judges, these naturally are the most

¹ ‘Esse sub plegio standi recto (ad standum recto) si quis versus eum loqui
voluerit,' is a very common phrase. Bracton‚ f. 153-4.

at the lines and amercements in these rolls. we shall understand the
. annalist who asew years afterwards tells us that, when the judges
came into Comwall‚ all the people (omnes), lor fear ol them, fled into
the woods, and could hardly be induced to come out again ¹. Il

John had been a farsighted methodic tyrant, the eyres in his day
’ would have been frequent and regular; but then he would not
have been able to attract the Gerards and Engelards to his side.
Nor is there any reason for supposing that Gloucester had been
uniquely neglected. In 1228 the last eyre in the Cinque Ports was

hardly within the memory of man ². The other records ol the eyre
of 1221 are almost or quite as bulky as this Gloucestershire roll,
and if these be compared with the brief iter rolls ol Richard’s reign,
printed by Palgrave, the conclusion that in 1221 there had been no
eyre lor along time past will seem the more prohable.

We must not, however, suppose that Gloucestershire had been
quite without penal justice. There may have been gaol deliveries.

We shall hear ol one (date unknown) by Henry de Vere ⁸. But¹

from such rolls as are extant it would seem that in the early part
ol the thirteenth century gaol delivery was light work. In this
record we shall read little of prisoners, and most ol those mentioned
have either broken prison or been hailed out by the sheriff lora
valuable consideration. Nor does it appear that this period knew
any form of judicial visitation sor the purpose of punishing crime
intermediate between the mere gaol delivery and the general eyre.
What criminal jurisdiction was possessed by the county court isa
difficult question, but plainly it was already very limited ⁴. It could
hang a thiel taken in the act, and could punish some minor breaches
of the peace. Also we shall see that the county court had
burnt a man lor arson Β; but lor this it had the king's writ, and itis
not possible to say how osten writs of the same kind had been
granted Lastly‚ there were manorial courts, which had power to
hang thieves who were taken by lresh suit and in seisin ol the
stolen goods. When, however, all allowances ol this kind have been

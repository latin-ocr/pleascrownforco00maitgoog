justices together with the writs of as'sizes and pleas, so that no assiae
or other plea may stand overby default of you or of your summons ¹.
And cause to be proclaimed and known throughout your whole
bailiwick that all assizes and all pleas which are adjourned and
unfinished before our justiees at Westminster should then be before
our aforesaid justices in the state in which they stood over by our
command at Westminster. And summon by good summouere all
those who have been sheriffs since the last eyre of the justices
in those parts that they be then before our aforesaid justices with
the writs of assizes and pleas which they received in their time and

Worcester on the 7th of June ². They next went to Gloucester.
Seemingly they began their Gloucester session on the arst of June;

had to paya brief visit to Bristol, whither they went to hear the
pleas of that town and as a special favour those of the neighbour-

Swinehead ought by rights to come to Gloucester. It is a little
difficult to fit together the stray references to dates, but ou the
whole it seems not improbable that civil business and crown
business were heard simultaneously, that there were then, as now,
two courts, a civil side and a crown side; at present, however, the
evidence of this is not sufficient to be worth retailing. From
Gloucestershire they went to Hereford, and from Hereford back
again to Worcester. They were in Warwickshire in September,
and seemiugly were thence going to Leicester. They were sitting
at Shrewshury in November.

It so happens that about this eyre of 1221 more may be known
than of any other of at all the same antiquity, Good luck has

xlvlll INTRODUCTION.

end ol the Gloucestershire session, and we have in it the very
latest intelligence. Lastly, it may be noticed that amongst the
civil pleas A has several enrolled instruments, deeds os grant and
the like, which B has not. Again, it records the election os the
coroners, which B does not It looks therefore as it A was the roll
which was to be kept in the treasury; the roll which would checlr
the sheriffs accounts; the roll to which a litigant might herealter
appeal as establishing some matter ol record. On the other hand,
Bmay be a roll belonging to the judges in general, or to some
judge in particular.

And now the transcribet must give an account os his
doings. I have copied lrorn A when A was legihle‚ and when
the margin os A was damaged so that an entry on that roll
wanted but a lew words to make it perlect, the corresponding
words have been supplied lrom B. I wish now that Ι had more
carelully noted the exact amount ol help derived in this way from
B, but it has been small. Whenever the entry in A was at all
seriously mutilated, the corresponding entry has been copied lrom
B, and the entries thus taken lrorn B may be known by the [B]
placed belore thern in the text. ’ ’

In the scot-notes attention is drawn to the material differences

between A and B, material, that is, in a lawyer's view; butol merely
verbal or literal differences Ι have in general made no note. This

transcript does not profess to be worthy os any philologist’s or
grammarian's attention. Il these rolls are worth editing as speci·
mensos medieval Latin (their value as such must, 1 should imagine,
be very small), they must be edited by some one much more
learned than I am.

Itis a difficult question how such a document as this is best
transcribed and printed. On theone hand, absolute fidelity seems
to require the use ol type which shall, as far as possible, reproduce
the marks ol abbreviation which are very freely used in the original.
But such type is repulsive to modern eyes, the use of it is expen-
sive, and, alter all, though it may confine the transcriber's chauces
of blundering within somewhat narrower limits, it still leaves a large
room wherein his ignorance and carelessness may display them-
selves. ln this case again the document itsell is in the salest custody
and is easily accessible to most ol those who would really care to ,
read a lacsimile ol it Therelore the most opposite course has
been taken, and I have endeavoured to write out in lull every abbre-
viated word. This certainly has given me abundant opportunities

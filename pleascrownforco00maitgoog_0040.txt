interesting. A few remarks about them will be found 311113
end of this book. Let it here only be noted that the time of
this eyre was a 111113 13331 31111331 13 the history of our criminal
procedure.

The ancient and still tbe normal mode of bringing a criminal to
justice was the appeal, a private suit against the wrong-doer brought
by the person primarily wronged. It is only by slow degrees that
we have learned to distinguish between crimes and injurias, and· only ·
by slow degrees was the theory framed that every crime is an injury
to the king in respect of which the king can sue. Again, the ancient
and still the normal mode of trying an appeal was battle. But of
late years, during the reigns of Henry the Second and Richard‚ and
such part of John’s reign as was not anarchy‚ the law had been

’ making rapid advances, both towards a more reasonable mode of

trial and towards a procedure less dependent on the will of the
person immediately wronged‚ more expressive of the fact that crime
wrongs the whole community.

As regards the mode of trying an appeal the books of Glanvill
and Bracton are two great landmarks In the former the appellee,
unless he be maimed, orbis fighting days are past, (in which cases
he goes to the ordeaL) has seemingly no choice, 113 13331 defend
himself by bis body¹; in the latter the appelles has always a 3113133,
Ι113 333 defend himself by his body, or by his country². Trial by
a sworn body of neighbours, already common in real actions, seems
to steal its way into criminal procedure without any definite legis-
lation³. It was not at first a mode of determining the substantive
question of guilt or innocence; 11 was used for the decision of pre-
liminary and incidental questions. One party to the appeal obtained
from the king, bought from the king, the privilege of having such
a question determined by an inquest; it may be the question
whether the appelles is really a maimed man who need not fight,
or whether the appellor is of kin to the slain man about whose
death he brings his suit, or some other question of the like kind.
But this new procedure was profitable to the king and was reason·

secret crime, 3. g. poisoning, cau defend himself otherwise 11133 by his body;

but finally, as 1 understand him. decides that even in that case 113 can go 1ο the ,

country. Mr. F orsyth thinks otherwise.

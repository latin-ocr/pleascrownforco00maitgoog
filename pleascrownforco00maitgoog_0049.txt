INTRODUCTION. v xlv

Itinere apud Gloucestriam anno Η. Regis serrendi¹ qurirlo. It begins
with civil business done at Gloucester. The seventh parchment
has the civil business done at Bristol. With the eighth begin the
pleas of the crown, which corneto an end on the nineteenth. The
twentieth has some civil pleas, and possibly is notin its proper
place. This roll has no list oi amercements.

The latter oi these rolla is in very good condition, while in the
tormer the lower part ol almost every membrane has suffered badly.
In general the damage has not gone iar beyond the margin, and
only some twenty or thirty cases are very seriously mutilated.
Again, while B seems sor the more part the work oi one hand, at
’ least some four different clerks have been employed upon A. The
strips of parchment in A are in general both longer and wider than
those in B, and perhaps herealter, when a sufficient number oi rolls
have been examined, this fact may prove to be of some significanie.
, The relation between these two rolla is intricate and curious.
The parts of them which contain pleas oi the crown have been
carehrlly compared. -In general they agree word for word, and
that too both in what seem to be blunders and in some very
strange phrases, literal translations oi English colloquialisms, and
the like. Again, in both there are what shall be called postscrz'pls,
that is to say, the clerk, having carried his report oi a case to a
certain point, has passed on to another case, and afterwards he, or
some other clerk, has gone back to the former case and added
some new facts, the verdict of a jury or the like. ln many
instances the fact that a passage is postscript is very obvious, ior
the scribe had not leit enough room for the additional materials
and was put to shiits sor space. What is clearly postscript in one
oi the rolls is generally postscript also in the other. Further‚ when
a phrase has been introduced into one by interlineation, a similar
interlineation is often found in the other; when a word has been

struck out in one it has often been struck out in the other also; '

¹ A modern hand has rightly noted how it is certo certius that this roll comes
from the time oi the third Henry, not os the second. The heading seems part
oi the document as originally written, and the strange mistake may cause doubt
as to whether the roll is not a transcript made at a time when such a blunder
would have been more natural than in 1221. But everything in the roll is
against this supposition. An endorsement old, but not so old 'as the record,
ascribes the roll to the cyre oi the Abbot oi Evesham in the fiith year oi Henry
Fitz John. This is in part written over a still older endorsement, which has

been so much rubbed that 1 mnnot read it. It might be worth an expert’s
attention.

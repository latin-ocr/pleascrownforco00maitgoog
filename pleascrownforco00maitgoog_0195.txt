cluth, de latitudine pannorum, and the like), were probably those 01
1197 given in Hoveden, vol. iv. p. 33 (Stubbs' ed.).

29. fatuari03 senaria is a barn ; Ducange also gives senarius, tenerius,
fenerium. 1 am not sure that 1 have read the word correctly.

30. cereta cart; cantamus, carter.

32. oum toto pisos, with all the fish3 enargiam, loaded.

33. 'Perre Normannorum. The lands of those Normans who,
when John lost Normandy, chose to be Frenchmen instead oi English·
men were forfeited. As to the forfeiture ol Pinnoclrshire see Rot. Cl.
i. 5 b; it is one ol the lew little districts that long kept the name
of skire.

35. This Jolm Marrhall is probably the nephew oi the great Earl and
a distinguished leader among the insurgent barons.

et peut sibl alluctari, and asts that this may be allowed him.
T his seems the technical phrase lor introducing a plea which shows
that the acc'usation must fail. See Bracton‚s. 119, where it occurs
repeatedly. William de la Chambre is not tried3 he pays ten marks,
and finds bail that he will appear in case an appeal is brought. The
charge against him of having murdered Simon of Segre is repeated
in a 54 by the jurors ol the hundred oi Cirencester; this doubtiess is the
explanation ol the words in the margin of 3 5, which 1 hesitatingly read
as item in cirencestn'a.

50. An early case of collusive conveyancing. The tenants on the
king’s manor come and sell (veniunt et vendunt) their lands to the
monastery or the hospital, and then take back their lands to hold of
the monks or hospitallers. Then‚ when required to perform their police
duties, e. g. as ale-conners, custodiens ol the assiae ol bread and beer,
and the like, they set up the monls' privileges, and the monks excom·
municate the sherili. The monks probably have charters which free
their tenants from suit to hundred courts and so forth. The imme-
diate recoursc to excommunication is very characteristic 01 the time.
(See Pearson‚ Hist. vol. ii. p. 5 5.)

buys the privilege ol being tried by twenty-four jurors in addition to
the twelve who have presented the matter.

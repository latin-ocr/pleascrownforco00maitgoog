dangerous outhurst, that of William os Albemarle¹. Just when the
judges at Gloucester were making inquiry into the past misdoings
ol Engelard os Cigogne, this same Engelard was under suspicion
ol complicity in Albemarle's treason. In 1²²3 Fawlres of Breaute
was up in arms¹; in the next year his brother William caught and
imprisoned Henry Braybroolr, one of the judges in eyre, and nearly
succeeded in catching Martin Pateshull himself⁸. William was
hanged, Fawlres was banished; but in the end Hubert fell, to be
supplanted for a while by Peter des Roches and the foreigners ⁴.

But all this is better told elsewhere. The treaty ofLamheth was
about a year old when an effort was made to do J'ustice throughout
the land. Seven sets ol judges were sent out in eyre. Almost all
the counties were to be visited; but not quite all: what we may eall
the mid-western counties were excepted, Gloucester, Herelord,
Worcester, Stafford, Shropshire, Warwiclr, Leicestert The reason
for this may have been that bad as matters might be in those
counties (and certainly we shall have cause to think that Gloucester
wanted a visitation) they were worse elsewhere. It seems probable
that this western district was not quite neglected. There was a gaol
delivery at Herelord in the autumn os raao⁸, and there is extante
roll which is believed to show that early in 1219 judges were sitting
at Warwiclr to take assises from just these excepted counties. But
the word assr'ae must not mislead us; in this context it means a
possessory action touehing land, an action in which, to use Brac-
ton’s terms, the plaintiff relies, not upon domrbticm, but upon
possessio. A commission to take assises is one thing, a commission
to deliver a gaol is another, a commission to hear all manner ol
pleas in a general eyre is a third.

At any rate, in the summer ol 1221 the turn sor these counties
came; there was to be an eyre in them and also in Comwall and
Wiltshire.

Seven judges were sent out; but only six sat at Gloucester, ior
the seventh was Ralph Musard, who lor some years past had been
and still was aberiff ol the county. In obedience to the rule
solemnly sanctioned hythe great charter he was specially forbidden

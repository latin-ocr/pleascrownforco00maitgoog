man (and every man ought to be a police-man) to a sense olbis
duties. This brought money to the treasury, and doubtless that
was an advantage3 but we should probably be wrong in regarding
the numerous amercements inflicted in this eyre as excessive or
unreasonable.

Very likely there was no clause in Magna Carta more grateful
to the mass ol the people than that about amercements. Amerce-
ments are not to be assessed save by the oath ol good men os the
neighbourhood¹. The judges then‚asthe presentments were brought
in, decreed an amercement in general terms. The clerk wrote in
his roll e! ideo in melericordriz, and put aazia, the abbreviation ol the
last of these words, in the margin. Then, when all other business
was over, came the time sor affeering the amercements‚ that is, lor
settling how much was in each case to be paid. This was doubt-
less done in accordance with the Charter per sacramentum proborum
hominum de caineto, with results which are recorded in the emerce-
ment rolls printed below. An examination of them will probably
lead to the opinion that the sums exacted, though substantial, were
not extravagant. The commonest sum is a hals-mark (6¹ 8⁶),
and this, or even a mark ortuo, would not crush a thriving town-
ship or hundred. The best evidence on this point is that John's
aheriffs had habitually taken far heavier fines, ten, fifteen, twenty
marks. When a murder was committed by one who was in the
mainpast ol the Abbot ol Cirencester the abbot paid no less a sum
than a hundred poundsl.

We ought to distinguish the fine lrom the amercement. At least
in later days the amount ol the fine was determined by the judges
themselves, and this distinction seems to have already existed⁸.
The line is generally paid as the price ior freedom from imprison·
ment; thus il a man begins a criminal suit, an appeal (appellum),
he finds pledges that he will prosecute (plegii de prosequendo), then,
is he withdraws from the suit (saretrudis), his pledges are amerced
(plegii q‘us in mttericordzb), but he himself must he taken and im·
prisoned(cap1blur) until he makes fine with the king. This he
sometimes does at once; then there is entry on the roll finemsecil
per tres marcas, or whatever the sum demanded by the judges may
be. For all sums thus to be pald a surety is usually required3 A de

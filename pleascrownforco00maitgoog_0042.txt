xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

we must resist the temptation to construet a theory out oi
inadequate materials¹.

Simultaneously with the process which put trial by jury by the
side of trial by battle there went on the process which put indict·
ment, or rather presentment, by the side of appeal. But in the
latter process there was more ol definite legislation. The jury ol
accusation, or oi indietment, was, if not created, made a regular
institution by the great ordinance os 1166, the Assize of Clarendon.
Ten years later new power was given to it by the Assize of North-
ampton. Under these laws, when the hundred-jury and the repre-
sentatives of the townships on their oath charged a man with
murder, robbery, or the lilre, he went to the ordeal of water, aud,
it found foul, he lost hand and foot. But some distrust oi the
ordeal was already shown; it the charge was oi the gravest and'
was generally believed, though the accused came clean from the
water, he had to abjure the realm.

Now in 1221 this procedure had just been rudely disturbed.
In 1²15 the Lateran Council condemned the ordeal, and at 'the
beginning ol Henry’s reign the relation ol England to Rome was
Ι such that this decree of the Church was at once and ol course
obeyed. As already said, the next eyre, and a very general eyre it
was, took place in the winter ol 1218-9. The judges had already
started on their J'oumeys when an order of the king in council was
sent round to them⁸. It was dated aoth Jan. 1219, and isos
such great moment in the history os our law, and seemingly so
little known, that its substance shall be stated—¹ When you started
on your eyre it was as yet undetermined what should be done with
persons accused ol crime, the Church having forbidden the ordeal.
For the present we must rely very much on your discretion to act
wisely according to the special circumstances of each case. But in
general these rules should be observedz-Persons accused and
suspected os grave crimes, such as robbery, murder, and arson, who
might still do harm were they suffered to abjure the realm, are to
be put in prison sor saie custody, but the imprisonment is not to be
ol such kind as to endanger life or member. Ii the crimes are ol
amiddle sort and the accused would have gone to the ordeal is the
ordeal had not been abolished‚ they may abjure the realm. Is the
crimes laid to their charge be small, then they must find pledge to

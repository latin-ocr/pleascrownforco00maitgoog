with her appeal ii she likes. l doubt whether general inferences should
be drawn lrorn cases in which there is talk of the war time ; the judges
are making peace and have a large discretion: see 15, 35, and 181.

male attornutus, in etiect this must mean maltreated; in two other
cases (4 34, 455) ottomare or atomare is used in the same sense. So far
as 1 know this is very uncornmon iu our law Latin, in which ottomare
generally means to turn to, as when a landlord attorns his tenant to a
new landlord, or a tenant attorns himself to a newlandlord; myattom·
atus is the attorney whom l have put in my turn. But the French have
a word more in point :-

atourner, v. a. parer, mais avec un sens de familiarite ou d'ironie
(Littre).

atorner‚ parer, orner, arranger; et dans un autre sens, changer,
defigurer (Roquefort).

lt seems to me that attornare or atomare in this roll means to give
aman apretty dressing. lt has been suggested to rne that there has been
attraction and confusion between attornore (ad-tomara) and adoratore.
See Diez, torn03 Du Gange, atoma, atomore, attornare, etc.

163.1n orto montellum, in the garden of the nuns. The word
monalium in the printed text should be corrected.

174. non potest dodim-0, Bracton uses this same phrase in the
. same context (f. 137). ln theory there is here no trial at all. The
criminal who is taken iu seisin of stolen goods, or in seisin oi the bloody
knife (saisitus de cni'pulo sanguinolento), is seised ol his crirne (soisiatus
derobm'o vel latrocinio, Ass. Clarend. c. 12,· saisitus dc murdro vella-
trociniovelroberia velsalsonm'a, Ass. Northarn.c. 3), and is uot allowed
to defend himself eitherby his bodyorbyhis country. Bracton says that
this was constellatio antiqua,· probably he refers to the llssizes ol Clar-
endon and Northarnpton‚ which sanctioned a rule oi tar greater antiquity.
See also Nos. 189, 394.

175. Thomas Roctsord had never, l think, been sheriff, but he was
deputysherili early in John’s reign. lt seems to me that this tale about
the golden penny was at the least fifteen years old. Observe that two
ol the four finders are dead.

181. This case illustrates what is meant by an indictment (indictam-
tum). The jurors ol Bradley having been charged to arrest the suspects
(molecrediti), Elias is arrested upon their indictment. He is brought
before the judges‚ and then these same jurors are arnerced because
they know nothing against hirn save what happened in the war time.

182. viridarii, the verderers.

183. This reference to a precedent is noteworthy. The judges have
got with thern the rolls of the last eyre.

189. habeut judicium nuum: this may be a euphemism for sus·
pendatur. The case seemsto be treated asoue in which the bloody knife
makes any trial unnecessary (see 174). On the other hand, the ad
judicium in the margin looks as ii judgment was not yet given, nor is it
plain to what the transgressio refers. Observa that John did not intend
to strike Peter.

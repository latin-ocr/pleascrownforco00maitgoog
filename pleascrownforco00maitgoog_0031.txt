[ΝΤ RODUC T ION. xxvii

according to Bracton, the jurors ought to proeure the arrest oi the
suspected persons, the malecreditr', whose crimes are to be pre-
sented, or, ii this cannot be done, then they must draw up a list oi
these suspects and deliver it to the judges ¹. Such a list doubtless
was the rotulus de prabatio, which will be mentioned in our record ⁹.
For the rest it does not appear that the y'urors put their present·
ments, their answers to the articles, into writing. The two rolls ol
which mention will be made hereaster look like the work ol clerks
who are writing down what they hear, not copying or even trans·
lating what they see ⁸.

It may now be possible' within a small compass to prepare the
reader sor the sort oi entries that are made in this record and at the
same time to draw his attention to alew very common phrases. We
are evidently dealing,notwithadocument carefully made up alter the
judicial business which it describes was over, but with a collection
of notes jotted down while that business was actually going on.
Consequently we must expect language which is summary‚ ellip-
tical, disjointed. It must be¹ allowed that the Latin is bad; by
which is meant not merely that it is medieval Latin (Bracton’s
Latin is good enough, though it is the Latin of the thirteenth, not oi
the first, century), but that it is bad Latin in the same sense that
modern ‘notes ol evidence' are bad English. One must read
it in jerks‚ as one would read the notes which y'udges and counsel
now make in court3 one must be prepared sor very sudden changes
oi nominative, and willing to fill up breaches of grammar with
common sense. The following is a not unfair parody oi the worst
entries before us :-

Robert was killed by William and fled to the outlawed, wasn’t in
{rank-pledge, was in township ol Stowe, therefore amerced, chattels
ὀᾶ, sheriff accounts.

We very soon see that it was William who ned and who is to bc
outlawed, that the township oi Stowe is to be amerced became
William was living there and was not in bank-pledge, that William's
chattels (which are forfeited) were worth 6⁶, and that lor this sum
the sheriff must account. What'was said in court must have been
said in English. Robert the smitlr and William the miller knew no
tongue but their own. The clerks had rapidly to turn into Latin
verdicts and presentments delivered not only in English, but in a

dialect of English which may have been very strange to them.

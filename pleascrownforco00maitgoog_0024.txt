can be more precise than this. That there had been no eyre in
Gloucester since Henry became king, that is to say for nearly five
years,is stated by the vrit quoted above. Again, a case will corne
before us in which we shall be told that the last eyre was held by
Simon Pateshull¹ (a judge much employed by John, whether or not
a hinsman of Martin is not known), and that two years afterwards
a person accuscd of homicide obtained pardon from John. This
gives us at the very least seven years. The Pipe Rolls it was hoped
would give precise information as to the last eyre; that hope has
not been quite fulfrlled: but the roll for John’s rath year speaks not
only of amercements by Engelard, but also of amercements by
Richard lilarsh and Simon Pateshull’. Itis thought that these may
have been the outcome of a regular eyre, and of the last regular
eyre; but there are amercements on later rolla, and on the other
hand there isevidence that in 1111 the judges carried back their
inquiry to a much remoter period³.

Indications of date are given chiefly by the names of past
sheriffs. Now, during the early part of John’s reign, the sheriff
was William Marshall, afterwards to become regent of the king·
dom. In the Pipe Rolls for the 6th,· ¹yth, and 8th years of the
reign he accounts for the shire; in the 6th by Thomas Rochford,
in the yth and 8th by Richard Husseburn, his deputies. Richard
Mucegros got the county on arst July, 1207 ⁴, and he is the
accountant in the roll for the 9th year3 Gerard of Athea accounts
in the roth and rrth years: he became sheriff on the 5th Jan.
1208 ³. The exact date at which he was succeeded by Engelard
is not known, but Engelard brings in the account for the rath and
the following years. On the 8th of July, 1215, he was succeeded by
Ralph Musard ⁸, who was still sheriff in 1111. Now this roll contains
many presentments which relate to the time of Engelard'‚ several
which relate to the time of Gerard⁸, and apparently there are

¹ On this, see Madox, Exch. vol. ii. p. 146. lt seems plain that Engclard
had acted as justice in his own county. Probably he had the king's writ and
was acting lawfully; bnt to make the sheriff a justice was even then a retrogres-
eive measure, and it seems to be assumed in some cases ou thls roll that
Engelard had been holding plens which he had no business to hold.

¹ The difficulty is in part due to the fact that, so far as conserus Gloucester‚
the Pipe Rolls which pass as those of 13 and 15 John are, to all seeming. rolla
for one and the same year. ¹

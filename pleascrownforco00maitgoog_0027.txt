made, it will still be clear enough that an enormous mass ol crime
had gone absolutely unpunished in the days ol King John.

Now the commission given to the judges in 1221 was lor a true
eyre, and was in the largest terms. All the civil business of
Gloucestershire is adjourned before them ; and from the civil part
ol the rolls whence we transcribe, it may be gathered that they
could hear all manner os pleas. Most oi those heard were indeed
possessory assizes, but there were proceedings on writs of right
and writs oi entry; there is one case ol nuisance and one ol debt.
Besides this there are divers deeds enrolled on the record, 3ηά
several ol the writs ol right seem to have been brought merely in
order that land should be conveyed by fine. These civil proceed-
ings have not been transcribed. What is now most wanted is not
so much acopyoi any one civil roll as alarge selection from many,
lor the ordinary forms ol action are well known, and one case ol
novel disseisin is in general tediously like another.

With the crown business it is otherwise. We have in print really
no means ol informing ourselves by actual examples as to how such
business was conducted in the early part ol the thirteenth century.
We are hardly yet in a position to say what is ordinary, what is
extraordinary. To throw light on this matter, it seemed well to
print one long and complete record. Its very repetitions will
serve to show what was the usual procedure, what the common
cnmes.

The assembly that met at Gloucester, in obedience to the above
writ, must have been large. The sheriff, Ralph Musard, ol course
was there; and the coroners, whose office was not yet thirty years
old, were there. As the names ol these coroners sometimes appear
without their official titles, it may be well to say that they were
Alexander Fitz Neal (filius Nigelli), Henry de Drois, Hugh ol
Cuillardvill, and Simon ol Matresdon (Matson). Then again there
must have been famous men in court. We see, lor instance, that
the two leaders ol the baronial party were there, Gilbert of Clare,
Earl of Gloucester ¹, 3ηά William, Earl Marshall', son ol the great
earl lately dead, that they could spealr up in defence of their own
rights and lranchises, or, il needlul, say a good word for one who in
the war had talren the barons' side. There must also have been a
sufficiency oi abbots and priors, il the summons was duly obeyed,
and the names of the recognitors in the civil cases show that the

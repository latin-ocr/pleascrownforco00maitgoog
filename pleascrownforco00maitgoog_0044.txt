xl INTRODUC Τ ION.

Bracton certainly does not speak out very definitely on this
point. He argues at length, but with great caution ¹, that if an
appeal has failed by the death or default of the appellor, it is the
king’s right and duty to prosecute the appellee, for the appellor is
not the only person wronged; the king is wronged, since his peace
hasbeen broken. But how can the king prosecute? lfou would
not have him fight; besides he cannot bring an appeal, for he can-
not say that he saw or heard the crime. The only possible mode
of trial therefore is by the country. The accused therefore must
be compelled to defend himself by the country. And after all
there is nothing strange in this; a woman, a maimed man, a man
over sixty, can bring an appeal, and in such cases it seems that the
appellee must be tried by the country. Well, it must be the same
when the king is the accuser.

When, however, we ask what is meant by compelling a man

ι to defend himself by his country, we only get in answer the phrase
that if he refuses he is seemingly undefended and quasi-convict.
This suggests that he is to be sentenced without further ado, and
this may be Bracton’s meaning. But for some reason or another he
did not cboose to speak very positively⁹. His language is that of a '
man who is hinting at a questionable and unpopular opinion. By

the beginning of Edward's reign formalism had prevailed3 the man
who would not put himself on his country could not be sentenced,
· could not be tried3 he was to be rigorously imprisoned until he

, uttered the words which would give the court jurisdiction to try
him³.

Only one other question can here be stirred r—When a man was
to-be tried what was the constitution of the inquest, of the body

· that tried him? In the first place we must be careful not to

anticipate later history by supposing that there was any jury that
tried him in the manner in which a modern petty jury tries a
modern culprit. The jurors who said that a man was or was not

¹ F. 14ab: ⁴ Videturetiam quod appellatus non solum tenetur appellanti immo
domino regi . . . . Recurrendum est igitur ad patriam. ut videtur, quod quidem
si inculpatus recusaverit videtur quod sit indefensus et per hoc quasi convietus

. . . . . igitur in iis casibus ut videtur tenetur quis se defendere per patriam?
¹ To this it can only be added that a rnan may have put himself on an
inquest ‘gratis vel invitus’ (f. 143), ξ sive sponte sive per oautelam inductus sive
per necessitatem'(f.14gb). The meaning of invitus and per necessitatem is

1 never explained.

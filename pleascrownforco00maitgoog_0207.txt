the jurors would have been taken, and, being favourable to him, he would
have gone quit. Still it may well have been prudent to give the king
ten marks. (See 343 and John's Charter, c. 36).

grans optulit se, ebo, he voluntarily surrendered himself a pri-
soner as one willing to stand his trial (stare recto).

404. prunnon, orennook, a measure ; but what measure, and whence
the name? See Ducange, crannocus, crannoca.

405. The variance between A and B might suggest that Gio de
Cigogne and Gio de Chanceaux were the same ,person3 but the clause
in John's charter which banishes them makes it clear that they were
distinct.

412. This entry has been made on roll A in large bold characters.
Apparently these four persons had been coroners for some time past.
Afterwards (4⁶ 5) Hugh of Cullardvill fines to be removed from his office, ,
and seemingly there is a new election.

414. Roger had often impounded (imporcaverat) Henry's beasts
(averia). Compare 416, in which another death has followed from a
like cause. Henry refuses trial, but to all appearance has a trial in the
regular form and is found guilty3 he pays a fairly heavy fine and is
bailed. Apparently no more will happen to him unless some one
appeals him (si quis versus eum loqui volumi). He is very leniently
treated; l think that he has a powerful friend who finds the 60·

fugare eamcam, to follow a plough.
gutta oaduoa, the falling drop, epilepsy.

419. Probably it was for military purposes that the Earl Marshall
cleared Gloucester castle 0f its prisoners.

434. Observe that this story is about twelve years old, per quandam
dt'em dominicam que fuit perires septimanas ante Natale. This use
of per seems very strange, hut l can maire nothing else of the text3
compare per duos annos in 3⁶²·

litigaverunt minvieem, probably this fine phrase only means
that there was a dispute. The phrase is again used in 436.

Et quesitus quam saetam ipse feeit3 the inquiry must be
made of Hugh the appellor, not of Peter the appellee.

Peter is compelled to go to the duel although he wants an inquisition
de adab. lt seems plain that he has no right to choose trial per patmum
instead of trial per corpus. Observe that he does not offer to pay for
an inquest; could he have bought one?

The day for the duel is the 3rst of July.

435. This is the last of the casesin which trial is refused. It seems that
the accused was admitted to bail; see 503, note 4, and the fme on p. r 33.

Since the Introduction to this book was written l have seen, in the

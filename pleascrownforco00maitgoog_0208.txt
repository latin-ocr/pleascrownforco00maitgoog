152 uorsa

touching the question what shall be done witha man who will not put
himself upon his country ¹. They are extracted from a roll that l can-
not find in the Record Office; they came before the bench at West·
minster almost directly after the end of this syre, namely, in the spring
os 1222.

ln the first case one John is accused of robbery and refuses to put
himself upon his country. But he was foundseised of a coat made of two
pieces (inventus est saisitus de una tunica partita), audone half of this
had belonged toa certain Walter. All the men of the township recog-
nise the coat, and all the men of the county an'd of the neighbourhood
testify that John is a thief. And so, because John was not within the
assize of our lord the king², and cannot denythe coat (non potest dedi-
cere tunicam), and has no lord who will replevy him, and there is
nothing in his favour (et omnia bona ei deficiunt), it is adjudged that he
is convicted and therefore, etc. There is no need to eupand this etc.
The next case is in many respects similar, one Hugh, accused of har·
bourlng thieves, refuses trial, and is not in frank-pledge. All the town-
ships and all the knights of the county testify that he is guilty, and he
cannot find pledges3 therefore he is committed to gaol in the custody
of the sheri'ff. .

Now over against the first case the annotator has written :-De eo
qui noluit se ponere super patriam set inventus fuit seisitus de latrocinio,
et omnia bona defecerunt ei quia non in franco plegio, nec habuit
dominum quicum advocaret et ideo. (The sentence is untinished, but
there is no need to finish it.)

The note against the second case is z-Alius eodem modo rettatus set
nonde aliquo saisitus, et malecreditus, noluit se ponere super patriam et
ideo committatur gaole qnia non potuit iuvenire plegios.

The one distinction that the annotator sees between the two cases is

that in the one there isseisin, and in the other not. Whether these two
cases finally committed the court to the doctrine that, when there is no
seisin, a man cannot be tried unless he consents to be tried, remalns to
be seen. The rolls of 1221 apparently show that the matter was then
in the greatest doubt.
. Having had occasion to mention this note-book, I must add that, quite
apart from any question as to who the annotator was,-a question that is
at present in the best hands—there can be no doubt at all that a very
substantial addition to the materials for our legal history has been made
by its discovery.

449. Two leaden collins, full of bones, have been found; a present os
them is made to the lepers

450. The end of this entry is rather obscure, but l think it means that
Richard Burgess (who had long been the deputy‚ or under-sheritl), is
accountable to the king for the felon’s chattels, and sor the king's year

² This no doubt means, as the annotator explains, that John was not in
trani-prema see Bracton, f. ¹53 b, l. a.

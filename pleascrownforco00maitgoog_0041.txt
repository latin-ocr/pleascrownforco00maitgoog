INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

able3 the class of questions which could be settled by it was not
definite, and the questions actually decided by inquest beccum in
course of time more and more substantial, more and more equiva-
lent to the general issue, guilty or not guilty. For instance, so
complete adelence as ,an olibi became a matter that might be
established by a jury. Another desence, still nearer to the general
issue, was maintained in the same way, namely, that the appeal was
the outcome elmere hatred and mallee (odc'cem et otro). From this
it would be no long step to the principle that adefendant has choice
between two modes os trial ; he can light or he can put himself on ·
his country for good and ill (etde bono etde molo ¹). In Bracton's
boot, though this general prlnciple has become law, we may yet see
traces os its growth. When an appeal has been brought the
appellee may plead some special defence, some exceptcb, and if he
establishes such an exceptio, the appealfails (cedit appellum). Α long
list os the possible exceptiones is given3 most of them, as we should
expect, go to the form of the appeal: they allege, e. g. that the neces·
sary words about the king's peace have not been used, or that suit
wtas not at once made in the county court, or the lilte. But among
these exceptiones we find the substantial delentes of otc'tc' and of
odciem ct otro ⁹. These we may regard as survivals from atime when
the appellee had not acquired a right to go to the country on the
general issue.

Now it would be rash to draw dogmatic inferences from one
record when many exist, but apparently this process of develop-
ment was not complete in 1221, that is to say, the appellee had as
yet no perfect right to decline the duel and put himself on his
country. There were delentes which could be established by in·
quest, but these had to be specially pleaded. The manner of
pleading them was this: the appellee first traversed the whole
accusation word by word (venit et desendet pacem domini regis et

selemiam et totum dc verbo in onwan), and then specially pleaded the
facts on thch he relied. These facts are generally introduced by
such words as set aestatem uolt dc'cerc et dicitquod. Seemingly,
however, unless these facts constituted some well-known lrind of
desence, such as olc'bi, the appellee was constrained to fight. But

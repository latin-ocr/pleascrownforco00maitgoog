JNT RODUC T ION. xxi

presentments of what happened in the days of Richard Mucegrosl,
andos Thomas Rochford'‚ who was not the last of William
Marshalfs deputieS, and who seems to have died before 1207⁸.
Couldwe therefore suppose that the inquiry ln 1221 was strictly
limited to what had happened since the last cyre, we should be
obliged to say that there had been no real eyre for at least some
fifteen years. It may be that the inquiry was only carried back
thus far in cases in which a former sheriff, coroner, or other officer
had received something for which he had not yet accounted. But
this will hardly meet all the cases, and it may be wise to suspend
judgment. It would certainly seem, from the words of the writ‚ that
the pleas of the crown which were to be brought before the judges
were only to be such as had arisen since the last eyre, and Bracton
distinctly says that to an indictrnent or an appeal it is a perfect
answer that, since the alleged facts took place, there has been an
eyre at which no presentment was made about the matter. But he
twice citesa case to prove this, and the case is from raa5⁴3 so
possibly in 1221 the rule was not yet strictly observed, and besides
there was much to maire the first eyre after John's reign an excep·
tlon from all rules. We must, it is feared, be content with saying
that the inquiry covered more than seven years, and it may be
much more than seven years, that a large number of presentments
refer to crimes which at the very least were six years old, since they
were committed during Engelard’s shrievalty, and that one appeal
was certainly about twelve years old'.

This may seem a strange conclusion. Was not John obliged to
promise in the Charter that judges should be sent four times a year
into every countyl Had not this clause been repeated in Henrys
first Charter, and repeated again (once a year being substituted for

four times) in his second Charter⁸i The answer is, that the pro·
mise was to send judges to take assizes, and that a commission to
take assizes is an utterly different thing from a commission to hold
a general eyre. To call for more frequent eyres would have been ’
no popular cry, certainly it was not a cry likely to come from the
great barone. The eyre was the king's main checlr upon the feudal
jurisdictione. Nor was it popular with the vulgar. When we look

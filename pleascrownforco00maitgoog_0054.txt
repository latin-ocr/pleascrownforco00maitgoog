l INT RODUC T ION.

The following liberties have been taken with the text. The cases ·
bave been numbered. Arabio numerals have been used instead of

Roman ; instead ol xiii s. is printed 13⁸(13shillings); and instead ol

dir'n ‘nl is printed lm (a hall-mark, 6⁸ Sd). lllore small stops have
been inserted than there are in the original; but this has not been
done when there seemed the least danger that the change would
determine the meaning of au ambiguous passage. I have not been
particular about the use of capital letters, which in the rolls are
sparingly employed by some scribes and lavishly by others.

For the laults ol this book no onebut mysels is answerable.
Nevertheless l must thank lllr. Selby ol the Record Office lor having
assisted me in the reading ol some words. It hasbeen my happy
sortune to leam from Professor Vinogradoff very many things
which have made Bracton’s book sar more intelligible and interest·
ing to me than it was belore; I hope that I have only heard in
advance what he will soon make known to the world. From my
friend Frederick Pollockl have had not only the kindest encourage· '
ment, but also ready help out of many difficulties.

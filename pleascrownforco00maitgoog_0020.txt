xvi INTRODUCTION.

brought him into more serious trouble. At the end of the year

. γ’ Windsor and Odiham were taken from him ¹. But he soon made

his peace ², kept clear of the raid upon the judgeS, and went on
drawing his pensi0n³. Then he fought in Gascony⁴, and likely
enough did good service, for plainly he was a master of his craft.
At any rate he regained whatever royal favour he had lost. He
again held castles for the king, and in 1²34 even Windsor and
Odiham were given back to him, at a moment when the doings of
Peter des Roches and⁸his followers may have thrown into the
shade all older oppressions⁵. Some ten years later, near thirty
years aller his banishment, he died and left no heir ⁶. He died in
the lting’s debt, but the debt was forgiven in consideration of his
⁴ past services. Odiham, if not Windsor, he held at his death, and
his successor there was another foreigner named Simon of Mont-
fort. The best that has been said of him is, ‘vir in opere martio
probatissimus⁷.' These hated foreign shen'ffs are important figures
in the history of English law, as important after their kind as
Martin Pateshull or William Raleigh.

Now as to the way in which these aelf-made men had conducted
themselves in the county ol Gloucester our record may speak for

but any one who compares the references given above will, mutuaenutuae
that he and Engel. of Cigogne were all one. There is never mention of more
than one Engelard at a time. When chroniclers mention Eug. of Athe'e it is
aa keeper of Windsor, while in the Close and Patent Rolls the keeper of Windsor
is always Engel. of Cigogne. ln the Excerpts from the Fine Rolls (vol. i.
pp. 423-4) there are two entries immediately following each other, the one
supposes that Engel. of Athea, the other that Engel. of Cigogne, is just dead.
We have it from Wendover that Engelard was the cupos of Gerard of Athee
(vol. iii. p. 238). Lastly, unless 1 arn mistaken. the two places are within a
few miles of each other. lt may be seen, on a large-selle map of the modern
department of lndre et Loire, that close to Amboise, and close to Loches. are
Athte. Cigogne, Chauceaux, aud by my spelling, 1 have expressed the inference
that thence did Gerardus de Athlls, de Atya. etc, Engelardus de Cigoniis, de
Cigunny, de Ciconiaco, etc, Petrus de Cancellis, de Chaunceawa, etc, get their
names. A reference given by Mr. Peareon (Hist. vol. il. p. 90) first directed
my attention to this district as the right quarter.

famous Parliament oi Oxiord, in 1258, it was one oi the grievances
oi the barons that the hundreds had to pay murdro for the deaths os
these starved wretches². Then by the Provisions ol 1259 it was
ordained that there should be no fine in cases of occidental death ³,
and aller the Barons’ War this, with most ol the other Provisions‚
was incorporated in the Statute oi Marlborough ⁸. When men had
lorgotten whata murder fine was, this ordinance gave rise to the
strange belief that once ona time he who killed another by accident
was hanged as a morderer⁴.

In the history of law misunderstandings of this kind play a large
part, and very possibly to some such misunderstanding rs due the
remarkable institution ol the srank-pledge which is noticed in almost
every entry on the roll. When a man suspected oi crime has iled
the question at once arises whether there is not some one who is
bound to produce him and who must be punished ior not producing
him. Now the theoryis by this time well established that, at least
in general, every man ought either to be in irank-pledge or in the
. mainpast os some great man. It is not a rule without exceptions;
a clerk, sor instance, need not bein {rank-pledge, but still it is
the general rule. Now a man is bound to produce to answer t'or
their crimes all those who are oi his mainpast, that is to say, the
members of his household and his hired servants, those who are led
by his hand. Thus Hugh the Welshman‚ the servant oi Henry de
Crupes, es! de manupastu Henricide Crupes, Hugh slays Adam with
an axe and illes, and Henry not producing him is amerced³.
Bracton speaking oi this matter, and apparently relying on the
Leges Edwardi, says that by ancient custom the guest who sleeps
three nights in a house becomes part oi the householder's mainpast⁸.
But as to those men who are not oi another’s mainpast they ought
to be in [rank-pledge (in franco plegrb). About the early history
oi this curious institution volumes have been written ; it cannot be

began very early, and even Coke did not see through it. The number ot' ceses

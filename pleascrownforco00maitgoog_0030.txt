answer (υινιᾰίιίιινιι)ι to a set oi interrogatories which were called
Articles ol' the Eyre (Copt'lulo Iltirervs).

The articles ο1 the eyre had on this occasion been committed to
Martio Pateshull. A copy of them sve have not, but their tenor
can be inserted both from the ansvers of the jumrs, which are the
tramevrork oi this record, and from other sets os articles belonging
to the same period On theone hand, sve have the articles oi
1194’ 3ηά 01 1198' given by Hovedeu; on the other, there are the
articles given by Bracton. From Bracton we leam that the number
os interrogatories vas now larger, now smalier, variations being
introduced to meet the necessities ol time 3ηά place. He gives
tvo sets⁴3 the shorter ol the tvvo is adapted sor an eyre in the
Cinquc Ports and belongs to the same decade as our roll⁸; the
longer ol the two maywell come from a time but little later, bnt its
date has not been exactlyascertained. These being very accessible
are not here printed3 but almost every article in them might be
illustrated stom the record before us We might classiiy the
articles under the two heads of Revenue and Crime, but in so

doing might overloolt the fact that a distinction between the doing
ol penal justice aud the collection oi the lting's income is only
gradually emerging. The itinerant judge of the twelsth century

has much oi the commissiouer ol taxes. The inquisition ol 1194
included anement os the king’s demesue lands‚ and even inBracton
aud later books questions about murders and robben'es are curiously
mixed up with questions about escheats, vardships, marriagcs,
widows, Jews, ohurches, and other sources oi royal revenue.
Throughout the thirteeuth century the articles which deal with
- common crime are sev and general, and ior the more part remain
unaltered. The additional matter which in cotuse oi time greatly

. increases the number oi the articles chiefly consists oi detailed

inquiries into the irregular doings oi sheriffs 3ηά other officers⁶.
Seemingly the hundred-jury had time giveu it in which to

prepare its ansvers to these articles. Three of these Gloucester·

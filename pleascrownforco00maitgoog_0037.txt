plegr'r), to see, that is, that these associatione were in existence, and
this gave him an opportunity of amercing the townships. In many

mauors, however, this franchise, view of freni-pledge, was in the
hands of the lord.

The escape of a criminal who is not in frank-pledge is only one
of the many causes which may put a township in the king's mercy,

or, in other words, make it liable to be amerced. The township‚
for instance, is bound to present crimes at the local courts, and is
bound to see that dead bodies are not buried before the coroner or
the serjeant or baililf of the hundred has had view of thern (seha
vt'su coronatoris, servientis, ballam). The hundred-juries also are
very open· to amercement. They are constantly amerced, for not
presenting pleas, appeals, and other matters that ought to be pre-
sented (pro concelerante, pro concelamenlo loquelarum, pro cancela-
nunlo appella), and they may be amerced for presenting what they
‚ ought not to present, as, for instance, a plea that is not a plea of
the crown¹. There must be Judgment against the jurors of Hole-
ford quiin omnebus maleresponden125 the jurors of Blidesloe at first
appear with a miserably meagre tale, and being sent back to re·
consider their verdict, succeed in remembering a goodly number of
crimes⁸3 on the other hand, it is solemnly recorded that the jurors of
Langley give excellent answers⁴· Clearly therefore the judges have
some checlr upon the jurors, and know when they are answering
well and when badly; indeed there is an elaborate system of checlr
and countereheclr, the sheriff‚ the coroners‚ the sherill’s rolls, the
coroners’ rolls, the representatives of the townships, the hundred·
jurors, and finally the whole county, are checks upon each other:
any want of harmony between them is cause for amercementf.

If we were to regard an eyre merely as a mode of bringing
accused persons to trial, then ve should have to regard this eyre
as a very wretched failure. Murders and robberies there have been
in pfenty; indeed this roll bears witness to an enonnous mass of
violent crime: but in far the greater number of cases either no one
is suspected of the crime, or the suspected person has escaped‚
and no more can be done than to outlaw him. But eyres such as
the present, if frequent, would at least indirectly serve to bring about
a better state of things. Itis needless to say that professional
police there was none, and a just and regular infliction of pecuniary
penaltles was the only means of bringing the unprofessional police·
